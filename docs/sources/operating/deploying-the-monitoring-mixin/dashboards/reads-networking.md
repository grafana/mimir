# Reads networking

This dashboard shows receive/transmit bandwidth, inflight requests and TCP connections.
It is broken into sections for each service on the read path,
and organized by the order in which the read request flows.

Requires Kubernetes networking metrics.

## Example

The following screenshot shows an example of this dashboard from a demo cluster.
