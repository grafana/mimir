# Deploy Mimir with Helm

The [`mimir-distributed` Helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/) for Grafana Mimir and Grafana Enterprise Metrics allows you to configure, install, and upgrade Grafana Mimir or Grafana Enterprise Metrics within a Kubernetes cluster.

To deploy Mimir using the `mimir-distributed` Helm chart, see [Get started with Grafana Mimir using the Helm chart](/docs/helm-charts/mimir-distributed/latest/get-started-helm-charts/).
