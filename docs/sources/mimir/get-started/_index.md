# Get started with Grafana Mimir

You can get started with Grafana Mimir _imperatively_ or _declaratively_:

- **Imperatively**: The written instructions that follow contain commands to help you start a single Mimir process. You would need to perform the commands again to start another Mimir process.
- **Declaratively**: The following video tutorial uses `docker-compose` to deploy multiple Mimir processes. Therefore, if you want to deploy multiple Mimir processes later, the majority of the configuration work will have already been done.

## Before you begin

- Verify that you have installed either a [Prometheus server](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) or [Grafana Agent](/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/integrations/agent/flow/setup/install/).
- Verify that you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The instructions that follow help you to deploy Grafana Mimir in [Monolithic mode]({{< relref "../references/architecture/deployment-modes#monolithic-mode" >}}).

For information about the different ways to deploy Grafana Mimir, refer to [Grafana Mimir deployment modes]({{< relref "../references/architecture/deployment-modes" >}}).

## Download Grafana Mimir

In a terminal, run one of the following commands:

- Using Docker:

  ```bash
  docker pull grafana/mimir:latest
  ```

- Using a local binary:

  Download the appropriate [release asset](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/releases/latest) for your operating system and architecture, and make it executable.

  For Linux with the AMD64 architecture:

  ```bash
  curl -fLo mimir https://github.com/grafana/mimir/releases/latest/download/mimir-linux-amd64
  chmod +x mimir
  ```

## Start Grafana Mimir

To run Grafana Mimir as a monolith and with local filesystem storage, write the following YAML configuration to a file named `demo.yaml`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../../../configurations/demo.yaml)
```yaml
# Do not use this configuration in production.
# It is for demonstration purposes only.
multitenancy_enabled: false

blocks_storage:
  backend: filesystem
  bucket_store:
    sync_dir: /tmp/mimir/tsdb-sync
  filesystem:
    dir: /tmp/mimir/data/tsdb
  tsdb:
    dir: /tmp/mimir/tsdb

compactor:
  data_dir: /tmp/mimir/compactor
  sharding_ring:
    kvstore:

    kvstore:

ingester:

    kvstore:

    replication_factor: 1

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Grafana Mimir includes a system that optionally and anonymously reports non-sensitive, non-personally identifiable information about the running Mimir cluster to a remote statistics server to help Mimir maintainers understand how the open source community runs Mimir.

To opt out, refer to [Disable the anonymous usage statistics reporting]({{< relref "../configure/about-anonymous-usage-statistics-reporting#disable-the-anonymous-usage-statistics-reporting" >}}).

## Run Grafana Mimir

In a terminal, run one of the following commands:

- Using Docker:

  ```bash
  docker network create grafanet

  docker run \
    --rm \
    --name mimir \
    --network grafanet \
    --publish 9009:9009 \
    --volume "$(pwd)"/demo.yaml:/etc/mimir/demo.yaml grafana/mimir:latest \
    --config.file=/etc/mimir/demo.yaml
  ```

- Using a local binary:

  ```bash
  ./mimir --config.file=./demo.yaml
  ```

Grafana Mimir listens on port `9009`.

## Configure Prometheus to write to Grafana Mimir

Add the following YAML snippet to your Prometheus configuration file and restart the Prometheus server:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: http://localhost:9009/api/v1/push
```

The configuration for a Prometheus server that scrapes itself and writes those metrics to Grafana Mimir looks similar to this:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: http://localhost:9009/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: prometheus
    honor_labels: true
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
```

## Configure Grafana Agent to write to Grafana Mimir

Add the following YAML snippet to one of your Agent metrics configurations (`metrics.configs`) in your Agent configuration file, and restart Grafana Agent:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: http://localhost:9009/api/v1/push
```

The configuration for an Agent that scrapes itself for metrics and writes those metrics to Grafana Mimir looks similar to this:

```yaml
metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent/wal

  configs:
    - name: agent
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: agent
          static_configs:
            - targets: ["127.0.0.1:12345"]
      remote_write:
        - url: http://localhost:9009/api/v1/push
```

## Query data in Grafana

In a new terminal, run a local Grafana server using Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --name=grafana --network=grafanet -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

### Add Grafana Mimir as a Prometheus data source

1. In a browser, go to the Grafana server at [http://localhost:3000/datasources](http://localhost:3000/datasources).
1. Sign in using the default username `admin` and password `admin`.
1. Configure a new Prometheus data source to query the local Grafana Mimir server using the following settings:

   | Field | Value                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Name  | Mimir                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | URL   | [http://mimir:9009/prometheus](http://mimir:9009/prometheus) if you used Docker / [http://localhost:9009/prometheus](http://localhost:9009/prometheus) if you used local binary |

To add a data source, refer to [Add a data source](/docs/grafana/latest/administration/data-source-management/#add-a-data-source).

## Verify success

After you have completed the tasks in this _Get started_ guide, you can query metrics in [Grafana Explore](/docs/grafana/latest/explore/)
as well as create dashboard panels using your newly configured Grafana Mimir data source.
