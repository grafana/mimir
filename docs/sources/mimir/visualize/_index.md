# Visualize metric data

[Grafana](/grafana/download/) has built-in support for Mimir through the Prometheus data source type.

## Before you begin

> These steps are done in a local or on-premise instance of Grafana.

1. Log in to your Grafana instance.
   If this is your first time running Grafana,
   the username and password are both `admin`.
1. From within Grafana, go to `Connections` > `Add new connection`.
1. Search for Prometheus, and select **Create a Prometheus data source**.
1. In the **HTTP** > **Prometheus server URL** field, enter a server URL:

   - If you deployed Mimir via the `mimir-distributed` Helm chart,
     the default URL inside the Kubernetes cluster is `http://<HELM-RELEASE>-nginx.<MIMIR-NAMESPACE>.svc/prometheus`,
     and `http://<INGRESS-HOST>/prometheus` from the outside, provided that you set up an ingress.

   - If you are running microservices, point to the proxy in front of Mimir
     (such as Nginx or the GEM gateway) rather than to one component of Mimir.

## Steps

1. To view metrics in Grafana, select **Explore**.
1. From the top-left, select the newly created data source.
1. Select a metric, apply (optional) label filters, and select **Run query**.
1. Learn more about PromQL and querying by reading [Querying Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).
