# Visualize native histograms

Native histograms are experimental and subject to change.

Prometheus native histograms is a new data type beside the existing floating point time series in the Prometheus ecosystem that makes it possible to produce, store, and query a high-resolution [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) of observations.
To learn more about the native histograms data type and how to start sending native histograms to Grafana Mimir,
refer to [Send native histograms to Mimir]({{< relref "../../send/native-histograms" >}}).

In general not all visualizations support displaying the new native histogram data type, however you can use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to derive the usual floating point time series from native histograms that can be used in visualizations as before.

## Prometheus Query Language

The Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) allows you to query native histogram metrics. The data type of the result depends on the query and the underlying data.

For more information about PromQL, refer to [Querying Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

The following sections describe common ways to derive floating point time series from native histograms data for visualizations and also how to convert existing queries using classic histograms into queries using native histograms.

Note that the native histogram queries do not include the `_bucket`, `_sum` and `_count` suffixes of classic histograms.

### Query your histogramâ€™s count or sum

To query the total count of observations within a histogram, use the following queries:

```PromQL
# Native histograms:
histogram_count(sum(request_duration_seconds))

# Classic histograms:
sum(request_duration_seconds_count)
```

To query the total sum of observed values, use the following query:

```PromQL
# Native histograms:
histogram_sum(sum(request_duration_seconds))

# Classic histograms:
sum(request_duration_seconds_sum)
```

### Find rate of observations

To query the rate of all observations calculated over 5 minute time window, use the following query:

```PromQL
# Native histograms:
histogram_count(sum(rate(request_duration_seconds[5m])))

# Classic histograms:
sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_count[5m]))
```

To query the rate of observations between two values such as `0` and `2` seconds, use the following query:

```PromQL
# Native histograms:
histogram_fraction(0, 2, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds[5m])))
*
histogram_count(sum(rate(request_duration_seconds[5m])))

# Classic histograms:
sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="2.5"}[5m]))
```

There is a native histogram function that estimates the fraction of the total number of observations that fall within a certain interval, such as `[0, 2]`.
For more information, refer to [histogram fraction](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#histogram_fraction).

Classic histograms have no such function. Therefore, if the lower and upper bounds of the interval do not line up with the bucket boundaries of a classic histogram,
you have to estimate the fraction manually.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Only ever use the `histogram_fraction` function by including `rate` or `increase` inside of it with a suitable range selector.
If you do not specify a range, such as `5m`, the function uses the current value of the histogram.
In that case, the current value is an accumulated value over the lifespan of the histogram or since the histogram was last reset.

### Quantiles

To query an upper bound of observation values that 95% of observations fall under, use the following query:

```PromQL
# Native histograms:
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds[5m])))

# Classic histograms:
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) (rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Only ever use the `histogram_quantile` function by including `rate` or `increase` inside of it with a suitable range selector.
If you do not specify a range, such as `5m`, the function uses the current value of the histogram.
In that case, the current value is an accumulated value over the lifespan of the histogram or since the histogram was last reset.

## Create Grafana dashboards

The panel types [Histogram](/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/histogram/) and [Heatmap](/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/heatmap/) are compatible with the new native histogram data type. Use these to visualize a query such as:

```PromQL
sum(rate(request_duration_seconds[$__rate_interval]))
```

For all other panel types, for example [Timeseries](/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/time-series/), use one of the histogram functions above in [Prometheus Query Language](#prometheus-query-language) to visualize a derived float time series.

## Grafana classic explore

In [Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/), use one of the histogram functions above in [Prometheus Query Language](#prometheus-query-language) to visualize a derived float time series.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Visualizing native histogram data type directly without the histogram functions in the **Explore** view is a work in progress.
