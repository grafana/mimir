# Grafana Mimir HTTP API

Grafana Mimir exposes an HTTP API that you can use to write and query time series data, and operate the cluster.

This document groups API endpoints by service. Note that the API endpoints are exposed when you run Grafana Mimir in microservices mode, monolithic mode, and read-write mode:

- **Microservices mode**: Each service exposes its own endpoints.
- **Monolithic mode**: The Grafana Mimir instance exposes all API endpoints.
- **Read-write mode**: The component services are exposed on the endpoint that they are contained within. Either Mimir read, Mimir write, or Mimir backend. Refer to [Deployment modes]({{< relref "../architecture/deployment-modes" >}}) for the grouping of components.

### Path prefixes

The following table provides usage of placeholder path prefixes, for prefixes that are configurable.

| Prefix                       | Default         | CLI flag                         | YAML configuration               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `<prometheus-http-prefix>`   | `/prometheus`   | `-http.prometheus-http-prefix`   | `api > prometheus_http_prefix`   |
| `<alertmanager-http-prefix>` | `/alertmanager` | `-http.alertmanager-http-prefix` | `api > alertmanager_http_prefix` |

### Authentication

Endpoints that require authentication must be called with the `X-Scope-OrgID` HTTP request header specified to the tenant ID.

If you disable multi-tenancy, Grafana Mimir doesn't require any request to include the `X-Scope-OrgID` header.

Multi-tenancy can be enabled and disabled via the `-auth.multitenancy-enabled` flag or its respective YAML configuration option.

For more information about authentication and authorization, refer to [Authentication and Authorization]({{< relref "../../manage/secure/authentication-and-authorization" >}}).

This endpoint is compatible with the Prometheus format query endpoint.

For more information about formatting queries, refer to [Prometheus' documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#formatting-query-expressions).

### Memberlist cluster

```
GET /memberlist
```

This admin page shows information about Memberlist cluster (list of nodes and their health) and KV store (keys and values in the KV store).

If memberlist message history is enabled, this page also shows all received and sent messages stored in the buffers.
This can be useful for troubleshooting memberlist cluster.
To enable message history buffers use `-memberlist.message-history-buffer-bytes` CLI flag or the corresponding YAML configuration parameter.

### Get tenant limits

```
GET /api/v1/user_limits
```

Returns realtime limits for the authenticated tenant, in `JSON` format.
This API is experimental.

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

The endpoint is only available if Grafana Mimir is configured with the `-runtime-config.file` option.

## Distributor

The following endpoints relate to the [distributor]({{< relref "../architecture/components/distributor" >}}).

### Remote write

```
POST /api/v1/push
```

Entrypoint for the [Prometheus remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

This endpoint accepts an HTTP POST request with a body that contains a request encoded with [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and compressed with [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy).
You can find the definition of the protobuf message in [pkg/mimirpb/mimir.proto](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/pkg/mimirpb/mimir.proto).
The HTTP request must contain the header `X-Prometheus-Remote-Write-Version` set to `0.1.0`.

To skip the label name validation, perform the following actions:

- Enable API's flag `-api.skip-label-name-validation-header-enabled=true`
- Ensure that the request is sent with the header `X-Mimir-SkipLabelNameValidation: true`

This feature supports the writes from non-standard downstream clients that have metric name not Prometheus compliant.

For more information, refer to Prometheus [Remote storage integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### OTLP

```
POST /otlp/v1/metrics
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
To send OTLP data to Grafana Cloud, refer to [Send data using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/).
{{% /admonition %}}

Entrypoint for the [OTLP HTTP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md).

This endpoint accepts an HTTP POST request with a body that contains a request encoded with [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and optionally compressed with [GZIP](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/).
You can find the definition of the protobuf message in [metrics.proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Distributor ring status

```
GET /distributor/ring
```

This endpoint displays a web page with the distributor hash ring status, including the state, and the health and last heartbeat time of each distributor.

### Tenants stats

```
GET /distributor/all_user_stats
```

This endpoint displays a web page that shows per-tenant statistics updated in real time, including the total number of active series across all ingesters and the current ingestion rate displayed in samples per second.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
This endpoint requires all ingesters to be `ACTIVE` in the ring for a successful response.
{{< /admonition >}}

### HA tracker status

```
GET /distributor/ha_tracker
```

This endpoint displays a web page with the current status of the HA tracker, including the elected replica for each Prometheus HA cluster.

## Ingester

The following endpoints relate to the [ingester]({{< relref "../architecture/components/ingester" >}}).

### Flush chunks / blocks

```
GET,POST /ingester/flush
```

This endpoint triggers a flush of the in-memory series time series data to the long-term storage.
This endpoint also triggers the flush when `-blocks-storage.tsdb.flush-blocks-on-shutdown` is disabled.

This endpoint accepts a `tenant` parameter to specify the tenant whose blocks are compacted and shipped.
This parameter might be specified multiple times to select more tenants.
If no tenant is specified, all tenants are flushed.

The flush endpoint also accepts a `wait=true` parameter, which makes the call synchronous, and only returns a status code after flushing completes.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The returned status code doesn't reflect the result of flush operation.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Prepare for Shutdown

```
GET,POST,DELETE /ingester/prepare-shutdown
```

This endpoint inspects or changes in-memory ingester configuration to prepare for permanently stopping an ingester
instance but does not actually stop any part of the ingester.

After a `POST` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint returns, when the ingester process is stopped with `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`,
the ingester will be unregistered from the ring and in-memory time series data will be flushed to long-term storage.
This endpoint causes the ingester to be unregistered from the ring when stopped even if you disable
`-ingester.ring.unregister-on-shutdown`.

A `GET` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint returns the status of this configuration, either `set` or `unset`.

A `DELETE` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint reverts the configuration of the ingester to its previous state
(with respect to unregistering on shutdown and flushing of in-memory time series data to long-term storage).

This API endpoint is usually used by Kubernetes-specific scale down automations such as the
[rollout-operator](https://github.com/grafana/rollout-operator).

### Shutdown

```
POST /ingester/shutdown
```

This endpoint flushes in-memory time series data from ingesters to the long-term storage, and then shuts down the ingester service.
After the shutdown endpoint returns, the operator or any automation that's used terminates the process with a `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` signal.
During this time, `/ready` does not return 200.
This endpoint unregisters the ingester from the ring even if you disable `-ingester.ring.unregister-on-shutdown`.

This API endpoint is usually used by scale down automations.

### TSDB Metrics

```
GET /ingester/tsdb_metrics
```

This endpoint returns low-level metrics exposed by per-tenant TSDB. This can be useful for troubleshooting.
Difference from `/metrics` is that metrics returned in `/metrics` are aggregated across all open TSDBs, while this
endpoint returns TSDB metrics only for specific tenant.

Requires [authentication](#authentication), authenticated tenant is one whose TSDB metrics are returned.

### Ingesters ring status

```
GET /ingester/ring
```

This endpoint displays a web page with the ingesters hash ring status, including the state, health, and last heartbeat time of each ingester.

### Ingester tenants

```
GET /ingester/tenants
```

Displays a web page with the list of tenants with open TSDB on given ingester.

### Ingester tenant TSDB

```
GET /ingester/tsdb/{tenant}
```

Displays a web page with details about tenant's open TSDB on given ingester.

## Querier / Query-frontend

The following endpoints are exposed both by the [querier]({{< relref "../architecture/components/querier" >}}) and [query-frontend]({{< relref "../architecture/components/query-frontend" >}}).

### Instant query

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/query
```

This endpoint is compatible with the Prometheus instant query endpoint.

For more information about Prometheus instant queries, refer to Prometheus [instant query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-queries).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Range query

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/query_range
```

This endpoint is compatible with the Prometheus range query endpoint. When a client sends a request through the query-frontend, the query-frontend uses caching and execution parallelization to accelerate the query.

For more information about Prometheus range queries, refer to Prometheus [range query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Exemplar query

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/query_exemplars
```

This endpoint is compatible with the Prometheus exemplar query endpoint.

For more information about Prometheus exemplar queries, refer to Prometheus [exemplar query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-exemplars).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Get series by label matchers

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/series
```

For more information, refer to Prometheus [series endpoint](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Get label names

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/labels
```

For more information, refer to Prometheus [get label names](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

#### Caching

The query-frontend can return a stale response fetched from the query results cache if `-query-frontend.cache-results` is enabled and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-labels-query` set to a value greater than `0`.

### Get label values

```
GET <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/label/{name}/values
```

For more information, refer to Prometheus [get label values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

#### Caching

The query-frontend can return a stale response fetched from the query results cache if `-query-frontend.cache-results` is enabled and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-labels-query` set to a value greater than `0`.

### Get metric metadata

```
GET <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/metadata
```

Prometheus-compatible metric metadata endpoint.

For more information, refer to Prometheus [metric metadata](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-metric-metadata).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Remote read

```
POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/read
```

Prometheus-compatible [remote read](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read) endpoint.

For more information, refer to Prometheus [Remote storage integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Label names cardinality

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_names
```

Returns label names cardinality across all ingesters, for the authenticated tenant, in `JSON` format.
It counts distinct label values per label name.

The items in the field `cardinality` are sorted by `label_values_count` in DESC order and by `label_name` in ASC order.
The count of items is limited by `limit` request param.

This endpoint is disabled by default and can be enabled via the `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` CLI flag (or its respective YAML config option).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

#### Count series by `inmemory` or `active`

Two methods of counting are available: `inmemory` and `active`. To choose one, use the `count_method` parameter.

The `inmemory` method counts the labels in currently opened TSDBs in Mimir's ingesters.
Two subsequent calls might return completely different results if an ingester cut a block between calls.
This method of counting is most useful for understanding ingester memory usage.

The `active` method also counts labels in currently opened TSDBs in Mimir's ingesters, but filters out values that have not received a sample within a configurable duration of time.
To configure this duration, use the `-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout` parameter.
This method of counting is most useful for understanding what label values are represented in the samples ingested by Mimir in the last `-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout`.
Two subsequent calls will likely return similar results, because this window of time is not related to the block cutting on ingesters.
Values will change only as a result of changes in the data ingested by Mimir.

#### Caching

The query-frontend can return a stale response fetched from the query results cache if `-query-frontend.cache-results` is enabled and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-cardinality-query` set to a value greater than `0`.

#### Request params

- **selector** - _optional_ - specifies PromQL selector that will be used to filter series that must be analyzed.
- **count_method** - _optional_ - specifies which series counting method will be used. (default="inmemory", available options=["inmemory", "active"])
- **limit** - _optional_ - specifies max count of items in field `cardinality` in response (default=20, min=0, max=500)

#### Response schema

```json
{
  "label_values_count_total": <number>,
  "label_names_count": <number>,
  "cardinality": [
    {
      "label_name": <string>,
      "label_values_count": <number>
    }
  ]
}
```

### Label values cardinality

```
GET,POST <prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_values
```

Returns label values cardinality associated to request param `label_names[]` across all ingesters, for the authenticated tenant, in `JSON` format.
It returns the series count per label value associated to request param `label_names[]`.

The items in the field `labels` are sorted by `series_count` in descending order and by `label_name` in ascending order.
The items in the field `cardinality` are sorted by `series_count` in DESC order and by `label_value` in ASC order.
The count of `cardinality` items is limited by request parameter `limit`.

This endpoint is disabled by default; you can enable it via the `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` CLI flag (or its respective YAML configuration option).

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

#### Count series by `inmemory` or `active`

Two methods of counting are available: `inmemory` and `active`. To choose one, use the `count_method` parameter.

The `inmemory` method counts the number of series in currently opened TSDBs in Mimir's ingesters.
Two subsequent calls might return completely different results if an ingester cut a block between calls.
This method of counting is most useful for understanding ingester memory usage.

The `active` method also counts series in currently opened TSDBs in Mimir's ingesters, but filters out series that have not received a sample within a configurable duration of time.
To configure this duration, use the `-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout` parameter.
This method of counting is most useful for understanding what label values are represented in the samples ingested by Mimir in the last `-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout`.
Two subsequent calls will likely return similar results, because this window of time is not related to the block cutting on ingesters.
Values will change only as a result of changes in the data ingested by Mimir.

#### Caching

The query-frontend can return a stale response fetched from the query results cache if `-query-frontend.cache-results` is enabled and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-cardinality-query` set to a value greater than `0`.

#### Request params

- **label_names[]** - _required_ - specifies labels for which cardinality must be provided.
- **selector** - _optional_ - specifies PromQL selector that will be used to filter series that must be analyzed.
- **count_method** - _optional_ - specifies which series counting method will be used. (default="inmemory", available options=["inmemory", "active"])
- **limit** - _optional_ - specifies max count of items in field `cardinality` in response (default=20, min=0, max=500).

#### Response schema

### Store-gateway tenants

```
GET /store-gateway/tenants
```

Displays a web page with the list of tenants with blocks in the storage configured for store-gateway.

### Store-gateway tenant blocks

```
GET /store-gateway/tenant/{tenant}/blocks
```

Displays a web page listing the blocks for a given tenant.

### Prepare for Shutdown

```
GET,POST,DELETE /store-gateway/prepare-shutdown
```

This endpoint changes in-memory store-gateway configuration to prepare for permanently stopping a store-gateway
instance but does not actually stop any part of the latter.

After a `POST` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint returns, when the store-gateway process is stopped with `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`,
the store-gateway will be unregistered from the ring.

A `GET` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint returns the status of this configuration, either `set` or `unset`.

A `DELETE` to the `prepare-shutdown` endpoint reverts the configuration of the store-gateway to its previous state
(with respect to unregistering).

This API endpoint is usually used by Kubernetes-specific scale down automations such as the
[rollout-operator](https://github.com/grafana/rollout-operator).

## Compactor

### Compactor ring status

```
GET /compactor/ring
```

Displays a web page with the compactor hash ring status, including the state, healthy and last heartbeat time of each compactor.

### Start block upload

```
POST /api/v1/upload/block/{block}/start
```

Starts the uploading of a TSDB block with a given ID to object storage. The client should send the block's
`meta.json` file as the request body. If the complete block already exists in object storage, a
`409` (Conflict) status code gets returned. If the provided `meta.json` file is invalid, a `400` (Bad Request)
status code gets returned. If the block's max time is before the tenant's retention period, a
`422` (Unprocessable Entity) status code gets returned.

The provided `meta.json` file must have a `thanos.files` section with the list of the block's files,
otherwise the request will be rejected.

If the API request succeeds, a sanitized version of the block's `meta.json` file gets uploaded to object storage as
`uploading-meta.json`, and a `200` status code gets returned. Then you can start uploading files, and once
done, you can request completion of the block upload.

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Upload block file

```
POST /api/v1/upload/block/{block}/files?path={path}
```

Uploads a file with a given path, for a block with a given ID. The file path has to be one of the following,
otherwise a `400` (Bad Request) status code gets returned:

- `index`
- `chunks/<6-digit number>`

The client must send the content of the file as the body of the request; if the body is empty, a
`400` (Bad Request) status code gets returned. If the complete block already exists in object storage,
a `409` (Conflict) status code gets returned. If an in-flight meta file (`uploading-meta.json`) doesn't
exist in object storage for the block in question, a `404` (Not Found) status code gets returned.

If the API request succeeds, the file gets uploaded with the given path to the block's directory in object storage,
and a `200` status code gets returned.

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

### Complete block upload

```
POST /api/v1/upload/block/{block}/finish
```

Initiates the completion of a TSDB block with a given ID to object storage. If the complete block already
exists in object storage, a `409` (Conflict) status code gets returned. If an in-flight meta file
(`uploading-meta.json`) doesn't exist in object storage for the block in question, a `404` (Not Found)
status code gets returned. If the compactor has reached its limit for the maximum
number of concurrent block upload validations, which is configured with `-compactor.max-block-upload-validation-concurrency`,
a `429` (Too Many Requests) will be returned.

If the API request succeeds, compactor will start the block validation in the background. If the background validation
passes block upload is finished by renaming in-flight meta file to `meta.json` in the block's directory.

This API endpoint returns `200` (OK) at the beginning of the validation. To further check state of the block upload,
use [Check block upload](#check-block-upload) API endpoint.

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

This API endpoint is experimental and subject to change.

### Check block upload

```
GET /api/v1/upload/block/{block}/check
```

Returns state of the block upload. State is returned as JSON object with field `result`, with following possible values:

- `complete` -- block validation is complete, and block upload is now finished.
- `uploading` -- block is still being uploaded, and [Complete block upload](#complete-block-upload) has not yet been called on the block.
- `validating` -- block is being validated. Validation was started by call to [Complete block upload](#complete-block-upload) API.
- `failed` -- block validation has failed. Error message is available from `error` field of the returned JSON object.

**Example response**

```json
{ "result": "uploading" }
```

**Example response**

```json
{ "result": "failed", "error": "missing index file" }
```

Requires [authentication](#authentication).

This API endpoint is experimental and subject to change.

### Tenant Delete Request

```
POST /compactor/delete_tenant
```

```
GET /compactor/delete_tenant_status
```

Returns status of tenant deletion.

#### Response schema
