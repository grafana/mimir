# Grafana Mimir Slow queries dashboard

The Slow queries dashboard shows details about the slowest queries for a given time range and enables you to filter results by a specific tenant.

If you enable [Grafana Tempo](/oss/tempo/) tracing, the dashboard displays a link to the trace of each query.

This dashboard requires [Grafana Loki](/oss/loki/) to fetch detailed query statistics from logs.
