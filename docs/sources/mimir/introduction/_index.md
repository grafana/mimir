# Introduction to Grafana Mimir

Grafana Mimir is an open source software project that provides long-term storage for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry metrics. It allows you to extend Prometheus' capabilities through providing a robust solution for storing and querying metric data at scale.

## Key features of Grafana Mimir

With Grafana Mimir, you can:

- Handle large volumes of time series data through horizontally scaling Grafana Mimir across multiple machines.
- Replicate incoming metrics to make Grafana Mimir highly available and prevent data loss in the event of a failure or outage.
- Isolate data and queries from independent teams in the same Grafana Mimir cluster with multi-tenancy support.
- Store data long-term with Grafana Mimir's object storage capabilities.
- Use Prometheus remote write, PromQL, and alerting, as Grafana Mimir is fully compatible with Prometheus.
