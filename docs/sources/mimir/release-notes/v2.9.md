# Grafana Mimir version 2.9 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.9 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. For the complete list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Experimental support for optimized series selection strategy** Reduce the volume of data necessary to complete requests with individual label selectors that are present on a lot of series.
- **Reduced CPU utilisation for some shuffle sharding scenarios** Mimir queriers will now use significantly less CPU in cases where shuffle sharding is enabled with a high number of shards.
- **Reduced object storage API calls in compactors and rulers** Mimir 2.9 comes with optimizations that will reduce the amount of times compactors and rulers need to access rules stored in object storage.
- **Experimental support for streaming chunks from ingester to querier** This is expected to greatly reduce querier memory consumption when evaluating queries that select a large number of series, because chunks streamed from the querier can now be read into memory as needed.

### Helm chart improvements

The Grafana Mimir and Grafana Enterprise Metrics Helm chart is now released independently. See the [Grafana Mimir Helm chart documentation](/docs/helm-charts/mimir-distributed/latest/).

## Important changes

In Grafana Mimir 2.9 we have removed the following previously deprecated or experimental metrics:

- `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_requested_bytes_total`
- `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_returned_bytes_total`

The following configuration options are deprecated and will be removed in Grafana Mimir 2.11:

- The CLI flag `-querier.query-ingesters-within`. This configuration is moved to per-tenant overrides.
- The CLI flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled`.
- The CLI flags `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-min-bucket-size-bytes`, `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-max-bucket-size-bytes` and `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-chunk-pool-bytes`.
- The CLI flags `querier.iterators` and `-query.batch-iterators`.

The following configuration options that were deprecated in 2.7 are removed:

- The CLI flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.subrange-size`. A fixed value of 16000 is now always used.
- The CLI flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.consistency-delay`.
- The CLI flag `-compactor.consistency-delay`.
- The CLI flag `-ingester.ring.readiness-check-ring-health`.

The following configuration option defaults were changed:

- The default value for the CLI flag `-query-frontend.query-sharding-max-regexp-size-bytes` was changed from `0` to `4096`. As a result, queries with regex matchers exceeding this limit will not be sharded by default.
- The default value for the CLI flag `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` was changed from `0s` to `1d`. As a result, partial blocks resulting from a failed block upload or deletion will be cleaned up automatically.

## Bug fixes

- Store-gateway: Detect collisions in the postings cache. [PR 4770](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4770)
- Store-gateway: Fix panic caused by cached LabelValues responses with more than 655360 values. [PR 5021](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/5021)
