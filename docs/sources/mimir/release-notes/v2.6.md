# Grafana Mimir version 2.6 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.6 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. For the complete list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Lower memory usage in store-gateway by streaming series results**
  The store-gateway can now stream results back to the querier instead of buffering them. This is expected to greatly reduce peak memory consumption while keeping latency the same. This is still an **experimental feature** but Grafana Labs is already running it in production and there's no known issue. This feature can be enabled setting the `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` configuration option (if you want to try it out, we recommend you setting to 5000).

- **Improved stability in store-gateway by removing mmap usage**
  The store-gateway can now use an alternate code path to read index-headers that does not use memory mapped files. This is expected to improve stability of the store-gateway. This is still an **experimental feature** but Grafana Labs is already running it in production and there's no known issue. This feature can be enabled setting `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-enabled=true`.

### Alertmanager improvements

- **Webex support** Alertmanager can now use Webex to send alerts.

- **tenantID template function** A new template function `tenantID`, returning the ID of the tenant owning the alert, has been added.

- **grafanaExploreURL template function** A new template function `grafanaExploreURL`, returning the URL to the Grafana explore page with range query, has been added.

### Helm chart improvements

The Grafana Mimir and Grafana Enterprise Metrics Helm chart is now released independently. See the [corresponding documentation](/docs/helm-charts/mimir-distributed/latest/) for more information.

- The CLI flag `-ingester.max-global-exemplars-per-user` and its respective YAML configuration option `limits.max_global_exemplars_per_user`.
