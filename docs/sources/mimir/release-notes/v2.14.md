# Grafana Mimir version 2.14 release notes

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleWill = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Timeless = NO -->
<!-- Release notes are often future focused -->

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.14 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bug fixes in this release.
For the complete list of changes, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

The minimal supported version of Go is updated to 1.22.

The streaming of the chunks from store-gateways to queriers is enabled by default.

Alertmanager adds the `-alertmanager.log-parsing-label-matchers` configuration option to control logging when parsing label matchers.
This flag is intended to be used with `-alertmanager.utf8-strict-mode-enabled` to validate UTF-8 strict mode is working as intended.
The default value for the configuration option is `false`.

Alertmanager adds the `-alertmanager.utf8-migration-logging-enabled` configuration option, that enables logging of tenant configurations,
incompatible with UTF-8 strict mode. The default value for the configuration option is `false`.

Compactor adds a new `cortex_compactor_disk_out_of_space_errors_total` counter metric, that tracks how many times a compaction failed
due to the compactor being out of disk. A new related alert `MimirCompactorHasRunOutOfDiskSpace` and it's runbook are added.

Incoming OTLP requests were previously size-limited with the distributor's `-distributor.max-recv-msg-size` configuration.
Distributor has a new `-distributor.max-otlp-request-size` configuration for limiting OTLP requests. The default value is set to limit request to 100 MiB.

Distributor now replies with `Retry-After` header on retryable errors. The feature is controlled by the `-distributor.retry-after-header.enabled` configuration,
that is enabled by default.

## Important changes

In Grafana Mimir 2.14 the following behavior has changed:

When executing a remote read request, the querier now honors the start/end time range, specified in the read hints.

To prevent queue starvation with querier-worker queue prioritization algorithm, the querier now sets the minimum `-querier.max-concurrent` to four.
Values below the allowed minimum are ignored.

Distributor configuration's `-distributor.retry-after-header.max-backoff-exponent` and `-distributor.retry-after-header.base-seconds` are replaced
with `-distributor.retry-after-header.min-backoff` and `-distributor.retry-after-header.max-backoff` for easier configuration.

The circuit breakers in ingester are improved to not open in case of per-instance limit errors. Since now on the circuit breakers
trigger the opening only if push and pull requests exceed the configured duration.

The default inactivity timeout of active series in ingesters, controlled by the `-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout` configuration
is increased from `10m` to `20m`.

Query-frontend now returns the "413 Request Entity Too Large" error when a response shard from the `/active_series` request exceeds the limit.

Following featues of store-gateway are changed: `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent-queue-timeout` is set to 5 seconds;
`-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.lazy-loading-concurrency-queue-timeout` is set to 5 seconds;
`-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent` is set to 200;

Number of previously deprecated configuration options were removed in the release:

- the `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors` option in ingester
- the `-ingester.client.circuit-breaker.*` options in ingester
- the `-ingester.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` option in ingester
- the `-ingester.client.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` option in distributor and ruler
- the `-distributor.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` option in distributor
- the `-distributor.enable-otlp-metadata-storage` option in distributor
- the `-ruler.drain-notification-queue-on-shutdown` option in ruler
- the `-querier.max-query-into-future` option in querier
- the `-querier.prefer-streaming-chunks-from-store-gateways` option in querier and store-gateway
- the `-query-scheduler.use-multi-algorithm-query-queue` option in querier-scheduler
- the YAML configuration `frontend.align_queries_with_step` in query-frontend

## Experimental features

Grafana Mimir 2.14 includes new features that are considered experimental and disabled by default.
Use them with caution and report any issues you encounter:

A new experimental Kafka-based ingest storage architecture is added, that decouples the write and read path through a Kafka-compatible backend.
When enabled, distributors write incoming write requests to the Kafka-compatible backend, and the ingesters asynchronously replay ingested data from Kafka.

New related configuration options that enable and configure the new architecture in Mimir are: `-ingest-storage.enabled`, `-ingest-storage.kafka.*`,
`-ingest-storage.ingestion-partition-tenant-shard-size`, `-ingest-storage.read-consistency`, `-ingest-storage.migration.distributor-send-to-ingesters-enabled`,
`-ingester.partition-ring.*`.

Querier has an experimental streaming PromQL engine. The configuration option `-querier.query-engine=mimir` enables the engine.

Ingester added experimental `-ingester.ignore-ooo-exemplars` configuration. When set, the out of order exemplars are no longer reported
to the remote write client.

Querier now supports the experimental `limitk()` and `limit_ratio()` PromQL functions. The feature is disabled by default,
but can be enabled with the `-querier.promql-experimental-functions-enabled=true` setting in the query-frontend and querier.

Querier supports for the experimental `X-Mimir-Chunk-Info-Logger` header, that triggers logging information about TSDB chunks loaded from ingesters and store-gateways in the querier.
The header should contain the comma separated list of labels, for which their value will be included in the logs.

Ruler includes the experimental `-ruler.rule-evaluation-write-enabled` configuration, that disables writing the result of rule evaluation to ingesters.
This feature is meant to be used for testing.

## Bug fixes

- Ruler: add support for draining any outstanding alert notifications before shutting down. This can be enabled with the `-ruler.drain-notification-queue-on-shutdown=true` CLI flag.
- Query-frontend: fix `-querier.max-query-lookback` enforcement when `-compactor.blocks-retention-period` is not set, and viceversa.
- Ingester: fix sporadic `not found` error causing an internal server error if label names are queried with matchers during head compaction.
- Ingester, store-gateway: fix case insensitive regular expressions not matching correctly some Unicode characters.
- Query-frontend: "query stats" log now includes the actual `status_code` when the request fails due to an error occurring in the query-frontend itself.
- Store-gateway: fixed a case where, on a quick subsequent restart, the previous lazy-loaded index header snapshot was overwritten by a partially loaded one.
- Ingester: fixed timestamp reported in the "the sample has been rejected because its timestamp is too old" error when the write request contains only histograms.
- Store-gateway: store sparse index headers atomically to disk.
- Query scheduler: fix a panic in request queueing.
- Querier: fix issue where "context canceled" is logged for trace spans for requests to store-gateways that return no series when chunks streaming is enabled.
- Alertmanager: Fix per-tenant silence limits not reloaded during runtime.
- Alertmanager: Fixes a number of bugs in silences which could cause an existing silence to be deleted/expired when updating the silence failed. This could happen when the replacing silence was invalid or exceeded limits.
- Alertmanager: Fix help message for utf-8-strict-mode.
- Query-frontend: Ensure that internal errors result in an HTTP 500 response code instead of 422.
- Configuration: Multi line envs variables are flatten during injection to be compatible with YAML syntax.
- Querier: fix issue where queries can return incorrect results if a single store-gateway returns overlapping chunks for a series.
- HA Tracker: store correct timestamp for last received request from elected replica.
- Querier: do not return `grpc: the client connection is closing` errors as HTTP `499`.
- Compactor: fix a race condition between different compactor replicas that may cause a deleted block to be still referenced as non-deleted in the bucket index.
- Querier: fix issue where some native histogram-related warnings were not emitted when `rate()` was used over native histograms.
- Ruler: map invalid org-id errors to 400 status code.
- Querier: Fix invalid query results when multiple chunks are being merged.
- Query-frontend: return annotations generated during evaluation of sharded queries.
- Querier: Support optional start and end times on `/prometheus/api/v1/labels`, `/prometheus/api/v1/label/<label>/values`, and `/prometheus/api/v1/series` when `max_query_into_future: 0`.
- Alertmanager: Fix config validation gap around unreferenced templates.
- Alertmanager: Fix goroutine leak when stored config fails to apply and there is no existing tenant alertmanager.
- Querier: fix issue where both recently compacted blocks and their source blocks can be skipped during querying if store-gateways are restarting.
- Alertmanager: fix receiver firewall to detect `0.0.0.0` and IPv6 interface-local multicast address as local addresses.
