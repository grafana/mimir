# Grafana Mimir version 2.17 release notes

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleWill = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Timeless = NO -->
<!-- Release notes are often future focused -->

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.17 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bug fixes in this release.
For the complete list of changes, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

Grafana Mimir offers experimental support for the following features:

- Prometheus Remote-Write 2.0 protocol.
- Duration expressions in PromQL. These are simple arithmetics on numbers in offset and range specification.
- Promoting OTel scope metadata, including name, version, schema URL, and attributes, to metric labels, prefixed with `otel_scope_`. Enable this feature through the `-distributor.otel-promote-scope-metadata` flag.

You can enable Mimir Query Engine (MQE) through the experimental CLI flags `-query-frontend.query-engine` or `-query-frontend.enable-query-engine-fallback` or through the corresponding YAML options.

## Important changes

In Grafana Mimir 2.17, the following behavior has changed:

The Mimir Query Engine (MQE) is used by default. To use the Prometheus engine instead, set `-querier.query-engine=prometheus`.

The following default configuration values now apply to the memberlist KV store:

| Key                               | Value  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| `memberlist.packet-dial-timeout`    | `500ms` |
| `memberlist.packet-write-timeout`   | `500ms` |
| `memberlist.max-concurrent-writes`  | `5`      |
| `memberlist.acquire-writer-timeout` | `1s`    |

These values perform better but might cause long-running packets to be dropped in high-latency networks.

The `-ruler-storage.cache.rule-group-enabled` experimental CLI flag has been removed. Caching rule group contents is now always enabled when a cache is configured for the ruler.

The `-ingester.ooo-native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` CLI flag and corresponding `ooo_native_histograms_ingestion_enabled` runtime configuration option have been removed. Out-of-order native histograms are now enabled whenever both native histogram and out-of-order ingestion is enabled.

The `-ingester.stream-chunks-when-using-blocks` CLI flag and corresponding `ingester_stream_chunks_when_using_blocks` runtime configuration option have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The `cortex_distributor_label_values_with_newlines_total` metric has been removed.

## Experimental features
