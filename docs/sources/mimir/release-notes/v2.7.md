# Grafana Mimir version 2.7 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.7 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. For the complete list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Support for `keep_firing_for` option to ruler configuration**
- **Experimental query sharding improvements**:
  A new configuration parameter, `-query-frontend.query-sharding-target-series-per-shard`, allows query sharding to take into account cardinality of similar requests executed previously when computing the maximum number of shards to use.
- **Experimental support for native histogram ingestion**:
  Native histograms can now be ingested. The new per-tenant limit `-ingester.native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` controls whether native histograms are stored or ignored.

### Alertmanager improvements

- **New metrics** The following upstream metrics are now exposed:
  - `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_groups`
  - `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_alert_processing_duration_seconds`

### Helm chart improvements

The Grafana Mimir and Grafana Enterprise Metrics Helm chart is now released independently. See the [corresponding documentation](/docs/helm-charts/mimir-distributed/latest/) for more information.

## Important changes

In Grafana Mimir 2.7, the default vaules of the following configuration options have changed:

- `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` is now enabled by default with a value of `5000`.
- `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` has changed from `24h` to `13h`.
- `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration` has changed from `0` to `1m`.

In Grafana Mimir 2.7, the following configuration option is now deprecated:

- `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.subrange-size` since there's no benefit to changing the default of `16000`

In Grafana Mimir 2.7, the following have been removed:

- Experimental support for ephemeral storage introduced in Mimir 2.6.0 has been removed.
  - Following options are no longer available:
    - `-blocks-storage.ephemeral-tsdb.*`
    - `-distributor.ephemeral-series-enabled`
    - `-distributor.ephemeral-series-matchers`
    - `-ingester.max-ephemeral-series-per-user`
    - `-ingester.instance-limits.max-ephemeral-series`
  - The following metrics have been removed:
    - `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series`
    - `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_created_total`
    - `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_removed_total`
    - `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_total`
    - `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_failures_total`
    - `cortex_ingester_memory_ephemeral_users`
    - `cortex_ingester_queries_ephemeral_total`
    - `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_samples`
    - `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_series`
  - Additionally querying using the `{__mimir_storage__="ephemeral"}` selector no longer works. All label values with `ephemeral-` prefix in `reason` label of `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric are no longer available.

## Bug fixes

- Ingester: remove series from ephemeral storage even if there are no persistent series. [PR 4052](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4052)
- Store-gateway: return Canceled rather than Aborted or Internal error when the calling querier cancels a label names or values request, and return Internal if processing the request fails for another reason. [PR 4061](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4061)
- Ingester: reuse memory when ingesting ephemeral series. [PR 4072](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4072)
- Fix JSON and YAML marshalling of ephemeral_series_matchers field in /runtime_config. [PR 4091](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4091)
- Querier: track canceled requests with status code 499 in the metrics instead of 503 or 422. [PR 4099](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4099)
- Ingester: compact out-of-order data during /ingester/flush or when TSDB is idle. [PR 4180](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4180)
- Ingester: conversion of global limits max-series-per-user, max-series-per-metric, max-metadata-per-user and max-metadata-per-metric into corresponding local limits now takes into account the number of ingesters in each zone. [PR 4238](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4238)
- Ingester: track cortex_ingester_memory_series metric consistently with cortex_ingester_memory_series_created_total and cortex_ingester_memory_series_removed_total. [PR 4312](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4312)
- Querier: fixed a bug which was incorrectly matching series with regular expression label matchers with begin/end anchors in the middle of the regular expression. [PR 4340](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/4340)
