# Grafana Mimir tenant injector

The tenant injector is a standalone HTTP proxy that injects the `X-Scope-OrgID` header with the value that you specify in the `-tenant-id` flag into incoming HTTP requests. It then forwards the modified requests to the URL you specify in the `-remote-address` flag.

## Download the tenant injector

Download the tenant injector as a separate binary from Grafana Mimir. Refer to [Grafana Mimir releases](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/releases) on GitHub.

## Use the tenant injector
