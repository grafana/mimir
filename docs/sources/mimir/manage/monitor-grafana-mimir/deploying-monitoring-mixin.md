# Deploying the Grafana Mimir monitoring mixin

Grafana Mimir exposes a `/metrics` endpoint returning Prometheus metrics. You can configure your Prometheus server to scrape Grafana Mimir or you can use the built-in functionality of the [Helm chart to automatically send these metrics to a remote]({{< relref "./collecting-metrics-and-logs" >}}).
The endpoint is exposed on the Mimir HTTP server address / port which can be customized through `-server.http-listen-address` and `-server.http-listen-port` CLI flags or their respective YAML [config options]({{< relref "../../references/configuration-parameters" >}}).

## Dashboards and alerts

Grafana Mimir is shipped with a comprehensive set of production-ready Grafana dashboards and alerts to monitor the state and health of a Mimir cluster.

Dashboards provide both a high-level and in-depth view of every aspect of a Grafana Mimir cluster.
You can take a look at all the available dashboards in [this overview]({{< relref "./dashboards" >}}).

Alerts allow you to monitor the health of a Mimir cluster. For each alert, we provide detailed [runbooks]({{< relref "../mimir-runbooks" >}}) to further investigate and fix the issue.

The [requirements documentation]({{< relref "./requirements" >}}) lists prerequisites for using the Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts.

The [installation instructions]({{< relref "./installing-dashboards-and-alerts" >}}) show available options to install Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts.
