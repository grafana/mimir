# Grafana Mimir Compactor resources dashboard

The Compactor resources dashboard shows CPU, memory, disk, and networking metrics for the compactor.

Use this dashboard for the following use cases:

- Gain insight into the resource utilization of the compactor component within a Mimir cluster.
- Detect and analyze issues related to the compactor's resource consumption.
- Optimize the compactor's performance, ensuring efficient handling of compaction tasks without over-provisioning resources.

This dashboard requires [additional resources metrics](../../requirements/#additional-resources-metrics).

## Example

The following example shows a Compactor resources dashboard from a demo cluster.
