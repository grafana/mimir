# Grafana Mimir Queries dashboard

The Queries dashboard shows information about query queues, duration, retries, and details about query execution performance.

Use this dashboard for the following use cases:

- Observe the length and behavior of query queues to detect potential backlogs or delays.
- Analyze query durations and retries to identify slow or failing queries.
- Fine-tune query parameters, caching strategies, or resource allocations for improved performance.
