# Installing Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts

Grafana Mimir is shipped with a comprehensive set of production-ready Grafana [dashboards]({{< relref "dashboards/_index.md" >}}) and alerts to monitor the state and health of a Mimir cluster.

## Requirements

- Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts [require specific labels]({{< relref "requirements.md" >}}) to be set by Prometheus or Grafana Agent when scraping your Mimir cluster metrics
- Some dashboards require recording rules that you should install in your Prometheus

## Install from package

Grafana Mimir provides ready to use Grafana dashboards in the `.json` format and Prometheus alerts in the `.yaml` format, that you can directly import into your Grafana installation and Prometheus config.

The packaged dashboards and alerts have been compiled from the sources using a default configuration and don't allow you to customize the [required metrics label names]({{< relref "requirements.md" >}}).
If you need to customize the required metrics label names please choose one of the other installation options.

1. Download [dashboards](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/dashboards), [recording rules](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/rules.yaml) and [alerts](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/alerts.yaml) from Grafana Mimir repository
2. [Import dashboards in Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/#import-dashboard)
3. Install recording rules and alerts in your Prometheus

## Install from sources

Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts are built using [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org) language and you can compile them from sources.
If you choose this option, you can change the configuration to match your deployment, like customizing the [required label names]({{< relref "requirements.md" >}}).

1. Checkout Mimir source code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/mimir.git
   ```
2. Review the mixin configuration at `operations/mimir-mixin/config.libsonnet`, and apply your changes if necessary.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool
   GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb
   ```
4. Compile the mixin
   ```bash
   make build-mixin
   ```
5. Import the dashboards saved at `operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/dashboards/` in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/#import-dashboard)
6. Install the recording rules saved at `operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/rules.yaml` in your Prometheus
7. Install the alerts saved at `operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/alerts.yaml` in your Prometheus

Alternatively, you can compile the mixin in a container. To do so, replace the previous two steps with the following command:

```bash
make BUILD_IN_CONTAINER=true build-mixin
```

## Install dashboards from Jsonnet mixin

In case you're already using Jsonnet to define your infrastructure as a code, you can vendor the Grafana Mimir mixin directly into your infrastructure repository and configure it overriding the `_config` fields.
Given the exact setup really depends on a case-by-case basis, the following instructions are not meant to be prescriptive but just show the main steps required to vendor the mixin.

1. Install Grafana Mimir mixin
   ```bash
   jb install github.com/grafana/mimir/operations/mimir
   ```
2. Import and configure it
   ```jsonnet
   (import 'github.com/grafana/mimir/operations/mimir-mixin/mixin.libsonnet') + {
     _config+:: {
       // Override the Grafana Mimir mixin config here.
     },
   }
   ```
