# Configuring Grafana Mimir to use low resources with Jsonnet

This page describes how to configure Jsonnet to deploy Grafana Mimir in a Kubernetes cluster with low CPU and memory resources available.

## Anti-affinity

Given the distributed nature of Mimir, both performance and reliability are improved when pods are spread across different nodes.
For example, losing multiple ingesters can cause data loss, so it's better to distribute them across different nodes.

For this reason, by default, anti-affinity rules are applied to some Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets.
These anti-affinity rules can become an issue when playing with Mimir in a single-node Kubernetes cluster.
You can disable anti-affinity by setting the configuration values `_config.<component>_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`.

### Example: disable anti-affinity

```jsonnet
local mimir = import 'mimir/mimir.libsonnet';

mimir {
  _config+:: {
    ingester_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node: true,
    store_gateway_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node: true,
  },
}
```

## Resources

Default scaling of Mimir components in the provided Jsonnet is opinionated and based on engineersâ€™ years of experience running it at Grafana Labs.
The default resource requests and limits are also fine-tuned for the provided alerting rules.
For more information, see [Monitor Grafana Mimir]({{< relref "../../monitor-grafana-mimir/_index.md" >}}).

However, there are use cases where you might want to change the default resource requests, their limits, or both.
For example, if you are just testing Mimir and you want to run it on a small (possibly one-node) Kubernetes cluster, and you do not have tens of gigabytes of memory or multiple cores to schedule the components, consider overriding the scaling requirements as follows:

```jsonnet
local k = import 'github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util/kausal.libsonnet',
      deployment = k.apps.v1.deployment,
      statefulSet = k.apps.v1.statefulSet;
local mimir = import 'mimir/mimir.libsonnet';

mimir {
  _config+:: {
    // ... configuration values
  },

  compactor_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  compactor_statefulset+: statefulSet.mixin.spec.withReplicas(1),

  distributor_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  distributor_deployment+: deployment.mixin.spec.withReplicas(2),

  ingester_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  ingester_statefulset+: statefulSet.mixin.spec.withReplicas(3),

  querier_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  querier_deployment+: deployment.mixin.spec.withReplicas(2),

  query_frontend_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  query_frontend_deployment+: deployment.mixin.spec.withReplicas(2),

  store_gateway_container+: k.util.resourcesRequests('100m', '128Mi'),
  store_gateway_statefulset+: statefulSet.mixin.spec.withReplicas(1),

  local smallMemcached = {
    cpu_requests:: '100m',
    memory_limit_mb:: 64,
    memory_request_overhead_mb:: 8,
    statefulSet+: statefulSet.mixin.spec.withReplicas(1),
  },

  memcached_chunks+: smallMemcached,
  memcached_frontend+: smallMemcached,
  memcached_index_queries+: smallMemcached,
  memcached_metadata+: smallMemcached,
}
```
