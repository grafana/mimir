# Configure Grafana Mimir to allow Vault Agent to inject certificates and keys into Pods

When you enable this feature, Helm updates the annotations on all Pods that have TLS (transport layer security) configurable components.
When you deploy Mimir or GEM, Vault Agent fetches the relevant secrets from Vault according to the annotations and mounts them to the Pod.

> **Note:** Vault and Vault Agent must to be running already.

Example `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
vaultAgent:
  enabled: true
  roleName: "test-role"
  clientCertPath: "client/cert/path"
  clientKeyPath: "client/key/path"
  serverCertPath: "server/cert/path"
  serverKeyPath: "server/key/path"
  caCertPath: "ca/cert/path"
```

Generated Kubernetes Deployment YAML file based on the preceding example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: release-name
  labels:
    helm.sh/chart: mimir-release-1.2.3
    app.kubernetes.io/name: mimir
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: release-name
    app.kubernetes.io/component: comonent-name
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "123"
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
  annotations: {}
  namespace: "default"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: mimir
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: release-name
      app.kubernetes.io/component: component-name
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "test-role"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-client.crt: "client/cert/path"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-client.key: "client/key/path"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-server.crt: "server/cert/path"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-server.key: "server/key/path"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-root.crt: "ca/cert/path"
```

`vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-<FILENAME>: '<PATH>'` tells Vault Agent where to find the secret, and the name of the file to write the secret to. For example: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-client.crt: 'client/cert/path'` will look for the secret at the path `client/cert/path` within Vault, and mount this secret to the pod as `client.crt` in the `/vault/secrets/` directory.
