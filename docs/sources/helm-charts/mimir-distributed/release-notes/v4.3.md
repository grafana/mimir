# Grafana Mimir Helm chart version 4.3 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 4.3 of the Grafana Mimir Helm chart, which is compatible with Grafana Mimir v2.7 or Grafana Enterprise Metrics (GEM) v2.7. The `mimir-distributed` Helm chart is the best way to install Mimir on Kubernetes.

To learn about new features and enhancements in Grafana Mimir or GEM, see the release notes for [Grafana Mimir v2.7](/docs/mimir/v2.7.x/release-notes/v2.7/) or [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v2.7](/docs/enterprise-metrics/v2.7.x/release-notes/v2-7/).

> **Note:** If you are upgrading from a previous major version, review the changelog entry for all the major releases since then and perform the necessary migrations.

## Important changes

- The ruler deployment max surge was changed from `0` to `50%`, and max unavailable from `1` to `0`.

## Features and enhancements

Notable enhancements are as follows:

- **nginx autoscaling**
  Support autoscaling/v2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler for nginx autoscaling starting with Kubernetes 1.23.
- **Default pod security context**
  Set default pod security context under `rbac.podSecurityContext` for easier install on OpenShift.
- **Cache support for GEM's admin bucket**
  The cache will be enabled by default when you use the small.yaml, large.yaml, capped-small.yaml
  or capped-large.yaml Helm values file.
  > **Note:** For more information, refer to the [Grafana Enterprise Metrics configuration](/docs/enterprise-metrics/v2.7.x/config/).
