# Grafana Mimir Helm chart version 6.0 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 6.0 of the Grafana Mimir Helm chart, which is compatible with Grafana Mimir v3.0 and Grafana Enterprise Metrics (GEM) v3.0. The `mimir-distributed` Helm chart is the best way to install Mimir on Kubernetes.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bug fixes in this release. For a comprehensive list of changes, see the [Helm chart changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/CHANGELOG.md).

## Important changes

### Ingest storage architecture is now the default

Mimir is now deployed using the ingest storage architecture by default. This next-generation architecture decouples read and write paths using Apache Kafka or a Kafka-compatible backend.

The Helm chart deploys a single-node Kafka cluster for demo purposes. Set `kafka.enabled` to `false` to disable the deployment of the Kafka cluster. In production environments, you must configure Mimir components with credentials for an external Kafka-compatible cluster.

### Minimum Kubernetes version

The minimum compatible Kubernetes version has been updated to v1.29.

### Query scheduler is now required

The query scheduler is now a required component that is always used by queriers and query-frontends.

### Deprecated NGINX configuration removed

The deprecated `nginx` top-level values section has been removed. Use the `gateway` section instead. For migration guidance, refer to the [migration guide](https://grafana.com/docs/helm-charts/mimir-distributed/v5.6.x/migration-guides/migrate-to-unified-proxy-deployment/).

### GEM references removed

All remaining Grafana Enterprise Metrics (GEM) references have been removed from test configurations, reference files, and values.yaml.

### Grafana Agent deprecation

The `metaMonitoring.grafanaAgent` values have been deprecated. Grafana Agent was deprecated in early 2024 and reaches End-of-Support at the end of 2025. Instead of provisioning the agent's Kubernetes resources with `metaMonitoring.grafanaAgent.enabled`, collect Mimir's meta-monitoring data with an external collector. It is recommended to use Grafana k8s-monitoring, which manages the creation and lifecycle of Alloy instances and has built-in support for collecting telemetry from Grafana LGTM stacks.

### Performance tuning

The distributor now calculates `GOMAXPROCS` closer to the requested number of CPUs to reduce overhead on machines with many CPU cores.

### Default ingress routes

Ingress default routes now point to non-headless services.

### Provisioner image

The default kubectl image used by the provisioner job has been replaced with `alpine/kubectl`.

## Features and enhancements

Gateway ingress now supports labels for gateway ingress.

Store-gateway allows configuring options for emptyDir.

Support has been added for `revisionhistorylimit` for all deployments.

Components with predefined `GOMAXPROCS` and/or `GOMEMLIMIT` environment variables (distributor, ingester, querier, ruler-querier, store-gateway) now allow user-defined overrides through the components' `env` values.

Support has been added for `dnsConfig` for all components.

The `trafficDistribution` configuration option has been added to distributor, gateway, querier, query-frontend, query-scheduler, ingester, and store-gateway services to enable same-zone traffic routing.

The rollout-operator has been upgraded to 0.35.1. Note the required actions for upgrading the rollout-operator chart.
