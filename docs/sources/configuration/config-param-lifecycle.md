In order to simplify Mimir configuration, parameters are bucketed into 3 categories according to
their maturity and intended use: _basic_, _advanced_, and _experimental_.

## Basic

Flags that we expect the majority of customers to modify. For example, blobstore credentials or
other dependency connection information. These flags will generally remain stable for long periods
of time, and should focus on user goals.

## Advanced

Flags that we expect the majority of users to leave defaulted, but more experienced users
can use them to fine tune the system.

## Experimental

New flags that may be removed pending more confidence in their default values. For example, feature
flags to enable a new component or tuning parameters we arenâ€™t sure are necessary yet. These
flags are provided for customers who wish to become early adopters and for Grafana Labs internal
teams to gain confidence with new features. No flag should remain experimental for longer than
some period of time.
