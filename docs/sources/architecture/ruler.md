# Ruler

The **ruler** is an **optional service** that executes PromQL queries for recording rules and alerts. The ruler requires a database to store the recording rules and alerts for each tenant.

Ruler is **semi-stateful** and can be scaled horizontally.
Running rules internally have state, as well as the ring the rulers initiate.
However, if the rulers all fail and restart,
Prometheus alert rules have a feature where an alert is restored and returned to a firing state
if it would have been active in its for period.
However, there would be gaps in the series generated by the recording rules.
