# Grafana Mimir version 2.2 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.2 of Grafana Mimir, the most scalable, most performant open source time series database in the world.

Highlights include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. If you are upgrading from Grafana Mimir 2.1, there is migration-related information as well.
For the complete list of changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Support for ingesting out-of-order samples**: Grafana Mimir includes new, experimental support for ingesting out-of-order samples.
  This support is configurable, with users able to set how far out-of-order Mimir will accept samples on a per-tenant basis.
  This feature still needs additional testing; we do not recommend using it in production settings yet.
  For documentation see [Configuring out-of-order samples ingestion]({{< relref "../operators-guide/configuring/configuring-out-of-order-samples-ingestion.md" >}})

- **Improved error messages**: The error messages that Mimir reports are more human readable, and the messages include error codes that are easily searchable.
  For descriptions of errors, see the [Grafana Mimir runbooks / Errors catalog]({{< relref "../operators-guide/mimir-runbooks/_index.md#errors-catalog" >}}).

- **Configurable prefix for object storage**: Mimir can now store block data, rules, and alerts in one bucket, each under its own user-defined prefix, rather than requiring one bucket for each.
  You can configure the storage prefix by using `-<storage>.storage-prefix` option for corresponding storage: `ruler-storage`, `alertmanager-storage` or `blocks-storage`.

- **Store-gateway performance optimization**
  The store-gateway can now pre-populate the file system cache when memory-mapping index-header files.
  This can help the store-gateway avoid looking stuck while loading [index-headers]({{< relref "../operators-guide/architecture/binary-index-header" >}}).
  This feature is experimental and disabled by default; enable it using the flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled`.

- **Faster ingester startup**: Ingesters now replay their Write-Ahead-Logs about 50% faster, and they also re-join the ring sooner under some conditions.

- **Helm Chart improvements**: The [Mimir Helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed) is the best way to install Mimir on Kubernetes. As part of the Mimir 2.2 release, we're also releasing version 3.0 of the Helm chart. Notable enhancements follow. For the full list of changes, see the [Helm chart changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/CHANGELOG.md).
  - The Helm chart now supports [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift).
  - We have significantly improved the configuration experience for the Helm chart. The most salient one is that we've added a `structuredConfig` option, which allows you to overwrite specific key-value pairs in the `mimir.config` template, which saves you from having to maintain the entire `mimir.config` in your own `values.yaml` file.
  - We've improved the documentation for the Helm chart by adding a [Getting started with Mimir using the Helm chart]({{< relref "../operators-guide/deploying-grafana-mimir/getting-started-helm-charts/_index.md" >}}).

## Upgrade considerations

We have updated default values and some parameters in Grafana Mimir 2.2 to give you a better out-of-the-box experience:

- Message size limits for gRPC messages exchanged between internal Mimir components increased to 100 MiB from the previous 4 MiB.
  This helps to avoid internal server errors when pushing or querying large data.

- The `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` parameter changed from `0` to `10h`.
  The default value of `-querier.query-store-after` changed from `0` to `12h`.
  Both changes improve query performance for most-recent data by querying only the ingesters, rather than object storage.

- The option `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period` has been deprecated.
  If you previously changed this option from its default of `0s`, set `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to `true` and specify the lookback period by setting the `-querier.query-ingesters-within` option.

- The `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` parameter now defaults to false.
  When Mimir is using memberlist as the backend store for its hash ring, and it fails to join the memberlist cluster, Mimir no longer aborts startup by default.

If you have used a previous version of the [Mimir Helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed), you must address some of the chart's breaking changes before upgrading to helm chart version 3.0. For a detailed information about to do this, see [Upgrade the Grafana Mimir Helm chart from version 2.1 to 3.0]({{< relref "../operators-guide/deploying-grafana-mimir/upgrade-helm-chart-2.1-to-3.0/_index.md" >}}).

## Bug fixes

- [PR 1883](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1883): Fixed a bug that caused the query-frontend and querier to crash when they received a user query with a special regular expression label matcher.
- [PR 1933](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1933): Fixed a bug in the [ingester ring page]({{< relref "../operators-guide/reference-http-api/index.md#ingesters-ring-status" >}}), which showed incorrect status of entries in the ring.
- [PR 2090](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2090): Ruler in [remote rule evaluation mode]({{< relref "../operators-guide/architecture/components/ruler/index.md#remote" >}}) now applies the timeout correctly. Previously the ruler could get stuck forever, which halted rule evaluation.
- [PR 2036](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2036): Fixed panic at startup when Mimir is running in monolithic mode and query sharding is enabled.
