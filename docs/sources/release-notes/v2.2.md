# Grafana Mimir version 2.2 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.2 of Grafana Mimir, the most scalable, most performant open source time series database in the world.

Highlights include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. If you are upgrading from Grafana Mimir 2.1, there is migration-related information as well.
For the complete list of changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Support for ingesting out-of-order samples**: Grafana Mimir includes new, experimental support for ingesting out-of-order samples.
  This support is configurable, with users able to set how far out-of-order Mimir will accept samples on a per-tenant basis.
This feature still needs additional testing; we do not recommend using it in production settings yet.
  For documentation see [Configuring out-of-order samples ingestion]({{< relref "../operators-guide/configuring/configuring-out-of-order-samples-ingestion.md" >}})

- **Improved error messages**: The error messages that Mimir reports are more human readable, and the messages include error codes that are easily searchable.
  For descriptions of errors, see the [Grafana Mimir runbooks / Errors catalog]({{< relref "../operators-guide/mimir-runbooks/_index.md#errors-catalog" >}}).

- **Configurable prefix for object storage**: Mimir can now store block data, rules, and alerts in one bucket, each under its own user-defined prefix, rather than requiring one bucket for each.
  You can configure the storage prefix by using `-<storage>.storage-prefix` option for corresponding storage: `ruler-storage`, `alertmanager-storage` or `blocks-storage`.

- **Store-gateway performance optimization**
  The store-gateway can now pre-populate the file system cache when memory-mapping index-header files.
  This can help the store-gateway avoid looking stuck while loading [index-headers]({{< relref "../operators-guide/architecture/binary-index-header" >}}). 
  This feature is experimental and disabled by default; enable it using the flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled`.

- **Faster ingester startup**: Ingesters now replay their Write-Ahead-Logs about 50% faster, and they also re-join the ring sooner under some conditions.

- **Helm Chart improvements**: The [Mimir Helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed) is our recommended way to install Mimir on Kubernetes. As part of the Mimir 2.2 release, we're also releasing a major version bump to the Helm chart. Below we mention some of the most notable enhancements. For the full list, see the [Helm chart changelog](FIXME LINK).
  - The Helm chart now supports installing Mimir on OpenShift!
  - The Helm chart can now easily deploy Grafana Agent to scrape metrics and logs from all Mimir pods and ship them to a remote store, making it easy to monitor the health of your Mimir installation. For more information on how to set this up, see <docs link>. 
  - The Helm chart now enables multi-tenancy by default. This makes it easy for users to add tenants as they grow their cluster and take advantage of Mimir’s per-tenant quality-of-service features, which improve its stability and resilience at high scale. To learn more about how multi-tenancy in Mimir works, see [Grafana Mimir authorization and authentication]({{< relref "../operators-guide/securing/authentication-and-authorization" >}}). We’ve implemented this change in a way that is backwards compatible. To read about how we did this, see [#2117](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2117). 
  - We’ve significantly leveled up the configuration experience for the Helm chart. A few of the most salient changes:
    - We’ve added an `extraEnvFrom` capability to all Mimir services to enable injecting secrets via environment variables.
    - We’ve made it possible to globally set environment variables and inject secrets across all pods in the chart using `global.extraEnv` and `global.extraEnvFrom`. (Note that the memcached and minio pods are not included.)
    - We’ve switched the default storage of the Mimir configuration from a `Secret` to a `ConfigMap`, which makes it easier to quickly diff your Mimir configuration between upgrades. We especially like the [Helm diff](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff) plugin for this purpose.
    - We’ve added a structuredConfig option which allows overwriting specific key<>value pairs in the mimir.config template, rather than having to maintain the entire mimir.config in your own values.yaml.
    - We’ve added the ability to create global pod annotations. This unlocks the ability to trigger a restart of all services in response to a single event, like the update of the secret containing Mimir’s storage credentials. 
  - We’ve set the chart to disable `ingester.ring.unregister-on-shutdown` and `distributor.extend-writes` to make for a smoother upgrade experience. Now rolling restarts of ingesters should be less likely to cause spikes in resource usage. 
  - We’ve improved the documentation experience for the Helm chart by adding a [Getting started with Mimir using the Helm chart](FIXME LINK). 
  - We’ve added a smoke test for your Mimir cluster to help catch errors immediately after installing or upgrading via Helm. For more information, see <add link to ‘helm test’ header in getting started with mimi using the helm chart guide>.

## Upgrade considerations

We have updated default values and some parameters in Grafana Mimir 2.2 to give you a better out-of-the-box experience:

- Message size limits for gRPC messages exchanged between internal Mimir components increased to 100 MiB from the previous 4 MiB.
  This helps to avoid internal server errors when pushing or querying large data.

- The `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` parameter changed from `0` to `10h`.
  The default value of `-querier.query-store-after` changed from `0` to `12h`.
  Both changes improve query performance for most-recent data by querying only the ingesters, rather than object storage.

- The option `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period` has been deprecated.
  If you previously changed this option from its default of `0s`, set `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to `true` and specify the lookback period by setting the `-querier.query-ingesters-within` option.

- The `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` parameter now defaults to false.
  When Mimir is using memberlist as the backend store for its hash ring, and it fails to join the memberlist cluster, Mimir no longer aborts startup by default.

For users of the [Mimir Helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed), upgrading to Mimir 2.2 requires addressing some breaking changes made to the Helm chart. For a detailed walkthrough on how to do this, see our [Helm chart upgrade guide](FIXME LINK). 

## Bug fixes

- [PR 1883](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1883): Fixed a bug that caused the query-frontend and querier to crash when they received a user query with a special regular expression label matcher.
- [PR 1933](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1933): Fixed a bug in the [ingester ring page]({{< relref "../operators-guide/reference-http-api/index.md#ingesters-ring-status" >}}), which showed incorrect status of entries in the ring.
- [PR 2090](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2090): Ruler in [remote rule evaluation mode]({{< relref "../operators-guide/architecture/components/ruler/index.md#remote" >}}) now applies the timeout correctly. Previously the ruler could get stuck forever, which halted rule evaluation.
- [PR 2036](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2036): Fixed panic at startup when Mimir is running in monolithic mode and query sharding is enabled.
