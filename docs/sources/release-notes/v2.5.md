The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. For the complete list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Alertmanager Discord support**
  Alertmanager can now be configured to send alerts in Discord channels.

- **Configurable TLS minimum version and cipher suites**
  We added the flags `-server.tls-min-version` and `-server.tls-cipher-suites` that can be used to define the minimum TLS version and the supported cipher suites in all HTTP and gRPC servers in Mimir.

- **Lower memory usage in store-gateway, ingester and alertmanager**
  We made various tweaks related to how index lookups are performend and how the active series custom trackers are implemented, resulting in better performance and lower overall memory usage in the store-gateway and ingester.
  We also optimized the alertmanager, resulting in a 50% reduction in memory usage in use cases with larger numbers of tenants.

- **Improved Mimir dashboards**
  We added two completely new dashboards named `Mimir / Overview resources` and `Mimir / Overview networking`, furthermore we have made various improvements to these existing dashboards:
  - `Mimir / Overview`: Add "remote read", "metadata", and "exemplar" queries.
  - `Mimir / Writes`: Add optional row about the distributor's new forwarding feature.
  - `Mimir / Tenants`: Add insights into the read path.
