# Grafana Mimir version 2.5 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.5 of Grafana Mimir.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. For the complete list of changes, see the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Alertmanager Discord support**
  Alertmanager can now be configured to send alerts in Discord channels.

- **Configurable TLS minimum version and cipher suites**
  We added the flags `-server.tls-min-version` and `-server.tls-cipher-suites` that can be used to define the minimum TLS version and the supported cipher suites in all HTTP and gRPC servers in Mimir.

- **Lower memory usage in store-gateway, ingester and alertmanager**
  We made various changes related to how index lookups are performed and how the active series custom trackers are implemented, which results in better performance and lower overall memory usage in the store-gateway and ingester.
  We also optimized the alertmanager, which results in a 50% reduction in memory usage in use cases with larger numbers of tenants.

- **Improved Mimir dashboards**
  We added two new dashboards named `Mimir / Overview resources` and `Mimir / Overview networking`. Furthermore, we have made various improvements to the following existing dashboards:
  - `Mimir / Overview`: Add "remote read", "metadata", and "exemplar" queries.
  - `Mimir / Writes`: Add optional row about the distributor's new forwarding feature.
  - `Mimir / Tenants`: Add insights into the read path.

### Helm chart improvements

- **Meta monitoring as non-root**
  The Grafana Agent which performs the meta monitoring can now run in a non-root security context for better security.

- **Updated sizing plans**
  We updated our sizing plans to make them reflect better how we recommend running Mimir and GEM in production. 

## Bug fixes

- Flusher: Added `Overrides` as a dependency to prevent panics when starting with `-target=flusher`. [PR 3151](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/3151)
- Query-frontend: properly close gRPC streams to the query-scheduler to stop memory and goroutines leak. [PR 3302](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/3302)
