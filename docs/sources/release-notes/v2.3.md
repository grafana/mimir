# Grafana Mimir version 2.3 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.3 of Grafana Mimir, the most scalable, most performant open source time series database in the world.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. If you are upgrading from Grafana Mimir 2.2, there is upgrade-related information as well.
For the complete list of changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Ingest metrics in OpenTelemetry format**:
  This release of Grafana Mimir introduces experimental support for ingesting metrics from the [OpenTelemetry Collector's](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) [`otlphttp` exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter/README.md). This adds a second ingestion option for users of the OTel Collector; Mimir was already compatible with the [`prometheusremotewrite` exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter). For more information, please see [Configure OTel Collector]({{< relref "../operators-guide/configure/configure-otel-collector.md">}}).

- **Increased instant query performance**
  As an experimental feature, instant queries in Grafana Mimir now will get the same benefits of query sharding we see for range queries. When enabled, splitting instant queries by time will contribute in some cases to a speed up in instant query response time.

- **Tenant federation for metadata queries**
  Previously with tenant federation enabled, instant queries, range queries, and exemplars could be queried for multiple tenant by supplying multiple tenant IDs. With Grafana Mimir 2.3 we've added tenant federation support querying the `/api/v1/metadata` endpoint with multiple tenant IDs.

- **Simpler object storage configuration**:
  Users can now configure block, alertmanager, and ruler storage all at once with the `common` YAML config option key (or `-common.storage.*` CLI flags). By centralizing your object storage configuration in one place, this enhancement makes configuration faster and less error prone. Users can still individually configure storage for each of these components if they desire. For more information, see the [common section of the configuration reference.]({{< relref "../operators-guide/configure/reference-configuration-parameters/#common">}}).

- **DEB and RPM packages for Mimir**:
  Starting with version 2.3, we're publishing deb and rpm files for Grafana Mimir, which will make installing and running it on Debian or RedHat-based linux systems much easier. Thank you to community contributor [wilfriedroset](https://github.com/wilfriedroset) for your work to implement this!

- **Import historic data to Grafana Mimir**:
  Users can now backfill time series data from their existing Prometheus or Cortex installation into Mimir using `mimirtool`, making it possible to migrate to Grafana Mimir without losing your existing metrics data. This support is still considered experimental and does not work for data stored in Thanos yet. To learn more about this feature, please see [mimirtool backfill]({{< relref "../operators-guide/tools/mimirtool/#backfill">}}) and [Configure TSDB block upload]({{< relref "../operators-guide/configure/configure-tsdb-block-upload/">}})

- **New Helm chart minor release:** The Mimir Helm chart is the best way to install Mimir on Kubernetes. As part of the Mimir 2.3 release, weâ€™re also releasing version 3.1 of the Mimir Helm chart. Notable enhancements follow. For the full list of changes, see the [Helm chart changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/CHANGELOG.md).
  - We've upgraded the MinIO subchart dependency from a [deprecated chart](https://helm.min.io/) to the [supported one](https://charts.min.io/). This creates a **breaking change** in how the administrator password is set. However, as the built-in MinIO is not a recommended object store for production use cases, this change did not warrant a new major version of the Mimir Helm chart.
  - The backfill API endpoints for importing historic time series data are now exposed on the Nginx gateway.
  - Nginx now sets the value of the `X-Scope-OrgID` header equal to the value of Mimir's `no_auth_tenant` parameter by default. The previous release had set the value of `X-Scope-OrgID` to `anonymous` by default which [complicated the process of migrating to Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/issues/2563).
  - Memberlist now uses DNS service-discovery by default, which should decrease startup time for large Mimir clusters.

## Upgrade considerations

In Grafana Mimir 2.3 we have removed the following previously deprecated configuration options:

- The `extend_writes` parameter in the distributor YAML configuration and `-distributor.extend-writes` CLI flag have been removed.
- The `active_series_custom_trackers` parameter has been removed from the YAML configuration. It had already been moved to the runtime configuration. See [#1188](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1188) for details.

With Grafana Mimir 2.3 we have also updated the default value for `-distributor.ha-tracker.max-clusters` to `100` to provide Denial-of-Service protection. Previously `-distributor.ha-tracker.max-clusters` was unlimited by default which could allow a tenant with HA Dedupe enabled to overload the HA tracker with `__cluster__` label values that could cause the HA Dedupe database to fail.

## Bug fixes

- [PR 2447](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2447): Fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 429 to 500 when request queue is full in the query-frontend.
- [PR 2505](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2505): Memberlist KV store now tries to "fast-join" the cluster to avoid serving empty KV store.
- [PR 2289](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2289): Do not block the Ruler's "List Prometheus rules" API endpoint while syncing rules.
