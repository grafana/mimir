# Grafana Mimir version 2.3 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.3 of Grafana Mimir, the most scalable, most performant open source time series database in the world.

The highlights that follow include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. If you are upgrading from Grafana Mimir 2.2, there is upgrade-related information as well.
For the complete list of changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Support for OpenTelemetry Metrics ingestion path**:
  Grafana Mimir now has experimental support for ingesting metrics from the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) via two options: `prometheusremotewrite` and `otlphttp`. There is also experimental support for the OpenTelemetry Metrics ingestion path on `/otlp/v1/metrics`.

- **Added support to split instant queries by time**:
  As an experimental feature, instant queries in Grafana Mimir now will get the same benefits of query sharding we see for range queries. When enabled, splitting instant queries by time will contribute in some cases to an exponential speed up in instant query response time.

- **Object storage can now be configured for all components**:
  Object storage can now be configured for all Grafana Mimir components using the `common` YAML config option key (or `-common.storage.*` CLI flags), this enhancement reduces the total configuration overhead for running Mimir with object storage and centralizes your object storage configuration in one place reducing errors.

- **Add packaging for both debian based deb file and redhat based rpm**:
  With Grafana Mimir 2.3 we will be publishing a deb file and a rpm file of Grafana Mimir to make installation and running on debian or redhat based systems simpler. This was made possible by a community contribution from wilfriedroset.

- **Added `backfill` command to mimirtool to upload Prometheus TSDB blocks:**
  The `mimirtool backfill` command will make the process of back-filling Prometheus TSDB blocks, using an API available in the compactor, even easier which allows for a migration to Grafana Mimir while keeping your previous Prometheus TSDB data.

- **Helm Helm Chart improvements:** The Mimir Helm chart is the best way to install Mimir on Kubernetes. As part of the Mimir 2.3 release, weâ€™re also releasing version 3.1 of the Helm chart. Notable enhancements follow. For the full list of changes, see the [Helm chart changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/tree/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/CHANGELOG.md).
  - The MinIO sub chart dependency is upgraded from a deprecated Helm chart (https://helm.min.io/) to the supported chart's version (https://charts.min.io/). This includes a **breaking change** of how the administrator password is set, however as the _built-in_ MinIO is not recommended for production, this change did not warrant a new major version of the Mimir Helm chart.
  - The backfill API endpoints are now exposed on the Nginx gateway.
  - Default to injecting the `no_auth_tenant` from the Mimir configuration as the value for `X-Scope-OrgID` in Nginx instead of hard coded `anonymous`.

## Upgrade considerations

In Grafana Mimir 2.3 we have removed the previously deprecated configuration options:

- `extend_writes` YAML key and `-distributor.extend-writes` CLI flag from the distributor config.
- `active_series_custom_trackers` YAML key from the ingester config as it has been moved to the runtime config. See [#1188](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1188) for details.

With Grafana Mimir 2.3 we have also updated the default value for `-distributor.ha-tracker.max-clusters` to `100` to provide DoS protection.

## Bug fixes

- [PR 2447](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2447): Fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 429 to 500 when request queue is full in the query-frontend.
- [PR 2505](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2505): Memberlist KV store now tries to "fast-join" the cluster to avoid serving empty KV store.
- [PR 2289](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2289): Do not block the Ruler's "List Prometheus rules" API endpoint while syncing rules.
