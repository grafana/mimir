The **compactor** is an service which is responsible to:

- Compact multiple blocks of a given tenant into a single optimized larger block. This helps to reduce storage costs (deduplication, index size reduction), and increase query speed (querying fewer blocks is faster).
- Keep the per-tenant bucket index updated. The [bucket index](./bucket-index.md) is used by [queriers](./querier.md), [store-gateways](./store-gateway.md) and rulers to discover new blocks in the storage.

The compactor is **stateless**.

## How compaction works

The blocks compaction has two main benefits:

1. Vertically compact blocks uploaded by all ingesters for the same time range
2. Horizontally compact blocks with small time ranges into a single larger block

The **vertical compaction** merges all the blocks of a tenant uploaded by ingesters for the same time range (2 hours ranges by default) into a single block, while **de-duplicating samples** that are originally written to N blocks as a result of replication. This step reduces number of blocks for single 2 hours time range from #(number of ingesters) to 1 per tenant.

The **horizontal compaction** triggers after the vertical compaction and compacts several blocks with adjacent 2-hour range periods into a single larger block. Even though the total size of block chunks doesn't change after this compaction, it may still significantly reduce the size of the index and the index-header kept in memory by store-gateways.

## Compaction strategy

The compactor supports two compaction strategies, configurable via the `-compactor.compaction-strategy` flag (or its respective YAML config option):

- `default`
- `split-and-merge`

### `default` compaction strategy

The `default` compaction strategy runs the standard Prometheus TSDB compactor. For each tenant, the compactor sequentially compacts each group of compactable blocks. The compaction workload of a single tenant cannot be neither vertically scaled or horizontally scaled (when sharding is enabled).

This strategy is suited for clusters with small tenants.

### `split-and-merge` compaction strategy

The `split-and-merge` compaction strategy is a more sophisticated compaction strategy that allows to both vertically and horizontally scale compaction of a single tenant:

- **Vertical scaling**<br />
  The setting `-compactor.compaction-concurrency` allows you to configure max number of concurrent compactions running in a single compactor replica (each compaction uses 1 CPU core).
- **Horizontal scaling**<br />
  When [sharding](#compactor-sharding) is enabled and you run multiple compactor replicas, compaction jobs will be sharded across the available replicas.

The `split-and-merge` is designed to overcome TSDB index limitations and avoid that compacted blocks can grow indefinitely for a very large tenant (at any compaction stage).

This compaction strategy is a two stage process: split and merge.

For the configured 1st level of compaction (eg. 2h), the compactor divides all source blocks into N groups. For each group, the compactor compacts together the blocks, but instead of returning 1 compacted block (as with the `default` strategy), it outputs N blocks, called **split** blocks. Each split block contains a subset of the series. Series are sharded across the N split blocks using a stable hashmod function. At the end of the split stage, the compactor will have produced `N * N` blocks with a reference to their shard in the block's `meta.json`.

Given the split blocks, the compactor runs the **merge** stage which compacts together all split blocks of a given shard. Once this stage is completed, the number of blocks will be reduced by a factor of `N`. Given a compaction time range, we'll have a compacted block for each shard.

The merge stage is then run for subsequent compaction time ranges (eg. 12h, 24h), compacting together blocks belonging to the same shard (_not shown in the picture below_).

![Compactor - split-and-merge compaction strategy](/images/blocks-storage/compactor-split-and-merge.png)

<!-- Diagram source at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bHp8_zcoWCYoNU2AhO2lSagQyuIrghkCncViSqn14cU/edit -->

This strategy is suited for clusters with large tenants. The `N` number of split blocks is configurable on a per-tenant basis (`-compactor.split-and-merge-shards`) and can be adjusted based on the number of series of each tenant. The more a tenant grows in terms of series, the more you can grow the configured number of shards, in order to improve compaction parallelization and keep each per-shard compacted block size under control.

When sharding is enabled, each compaction stage (both split and merge) planned by the compactor can be horizontally scaled. Non conflicting / overlapping jobs will be executed in parallel.

#### How does it behave if `-compactor.split-and-merge-shards` changes?

In case you change the `-compactor.split-and-merge-shards` setting, the change will affect only compaction of blocks which haven't been split yet. Blocks which have already run through the split stage will not be split again to produce a number of shards equal to the new setting, but will be merged keeping the old configuration (this information is stored in the `meta.json` of each split block).

## Compactor sharding

The compactor optionally supports sharding.

When sharding is enabled, multiple compactor instances can coordinate to split the workload.

The actual sharding depends on the compaction stategy used:

- **`default`**<br />
  The compactor shard compaction workload by tenant. All the blocks of a tenant are processed by a single compactor instance at any given time, but compaction for different tenants may simultaneously run on different compactor instances.
- **`split-and-merge`**<br />
  The compactor shards compaction jobs, either from a single or multiple tenants. Contrary to the `default` strategy, compaction of a single tenant can be split and processed by multiple compactor instances.

Whenever the pool of compactors increase or decrease (ie. following up a scale up/down), tenants / jobs are resharded across the available compactor instances without any manual intervention.

The compactor sharding is based on the Cortex [hash ring](../architecture.md#the-hash-ring). At startup, a compactor generates random tokens and registers itself to the ring. While running, it periodically scans the storage bucket (every `-compactor.compaction-interval`) to discover the list of tenants in the storage and compacts blocks for each tenant whose hash matches the token ranges assigned to the instance itself within the ring.

This feature can be enabled via `-compactor.sharding-enabled=true` and requires the backend [hash ring](../architecture.md#the-hash-ring) to be configured via `-compactor.ring.*` flags (or their respective YAML config options).

### Waiting for stable ring at startup

In the event of a cluster cold start or scale up of 2+ compactor instances at the same time we may end up in a situation where each new compactor instance starts at a slightly different time and thus each one runs the first compaction based on a different state of the ring. This is not a critical condition, but may be inefficient, because multiple compactor replicas may start compacting the same tenant nearly at the same time.

To reduce the likelihood this could happen, the compactor waits for a stable ring at startup. A ring is considered stable if no instance is added/removed to the ring for at least `-compactor.ring.wait-stability-min-duration`. If the ring keep getting changed after `-compactor.ring.wait-stability-max-duration`, the compactor will stop waiting for a stable ring and will proceed starting up normally.

To disable this waiting logic, you can start the compactor with `-compactor.ring.wait-stability-min-duration=0`.

## Compaction jobs order

The compactor allows to configure the compaction jobs order via the `-compactor.compaction-jobs-order` flag (or its respective YAML config option). The configured ordering defines which compaction jobs should be executed first. The following options are supported:

- `smallest-range-oldest-blocks-first` (default)
- `newest-blocks-first` (not supported by `default` compaction strategy)

### `smallest-range-oldest-blocks-first`

It gives priority to smallest range, oldest blocks first.

To give you an example, let's assume you run the compactor with the compaction ranges `2h, 12h, 24h`. With this sorting, the compactor give preference to compact all 2h ranges first and among them it gives priority to oldest blocks. Then, once all blocks in the 2h range have been compacted, it moves to the 12h range and finally to 24h one.

### `newest-blocks-first`

It gives priority to most recent time ranges first, regardless of their compaction level.

To give you an example, let's assume you run the compactor with the compaction ranges `2h, 12h, 24h`. With this sorting, the compactor compacts up to the 24h range the most recent blocks first and the move to older ones. This policy favours most recent blocks, assuming they are the one most frequently queried.

This sorting is not supported by the `default` [compaction strategy](#compaction-strategy).

## Soft and hard blocks deletion

When the compactor successfully compacts some source blocks into a larger block, source blocks are deleted from the storage. Blocks deletion is not immediate, but follows a two steps process:

1. First, a block is **marked for deletion** (soft delete)
2. Then, once a block is marked for deletion for longer then `-compactor.deletion-delay`, the block is **deleted** from the storage (hard delete)

The compactor is both responsible to mark blocks for deletion and then hard delete them once the deletion delay expires.
The soft deletion is based on a tiny `deletion-mark.json` file stored within the block location in the bucket which gets looked up both by queriers and store-gateways.

This soft deletion mechanism is used to give enough time to queriers and store-gateways to discover the new compacted blocks before the old source blocks are deleted. If source blocks would be immediately hard deleted by the compactor, some queries involving the compacted blocks may fail until the queriers and store-gateways haven't rescanned the bucket and found both deleted source blocks and the new compacted ones.

## Compactor disk utilization

The compactor needs to download source blocks from the bucket to the local disk, and store the compacted block to the local disk before uploading it to the bucket. Depending on the largest tenants in your cluster and the configured `-compactor.block-ranges`, the compactor may need a lot of disk space.

Assuming `max_compaction_range_blocks_size` is the total size of blocks for the largest tenant (you can measure it inspecting the bucket) and the longest `-compactor.block-ranges` period, the formula to estimate the minimum disk space required is:

```
min_disk_space_required = compactor.compaction-concurrency * max_compaction_range_blocks_size * 2
```

Alternatively, assuming the largest `-compactor.block-ranges` is `24h` (default), you could consider 150GB of disk space every 10M active series owned by the largest tenant. For example, if your largest tenant has 30M active series and `-compactor.compaction-concurrency=1` we would recommend having a disk with at least 450GB available.
