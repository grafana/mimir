# v0.6.0 Release

## Changes

- [CHANGE] When using `rules` commands, cortex ruler API requests will now default to using the `/api/v1/` prefix. The `--use-legacy-routes` flag has been added to allow users to use the original `/api/prom/` routes. https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/pull/99
- [FEATURE] Add support for position rule-files arguments to `rules sync` and `rules diff` https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/pull/125
- [FEATURE] Add an allow-list of namespaces for `rules sync` and `rules diff` https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/pull/125
- [ENHANCEMENT] Handle trailing slashes in URLs on `cortextool`. https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/pull/128
- [BUGFIX] Fix inaccuracy in `e2ealerting` caused by invalid purging condition on timestamps. https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/pull/117
