  -blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-force

  -target comma-separated-list-of-strings
    	Comma-separated list of components to include in the instantiated process. The default value 'all' includes all components that are required to form a functional Grafana Mimir instance in single-binary mode. Use the '-modules' command line flag to get a list of available components, and to see which components are included with 'all'. (default all)
  -tenant-federation.enabled
    	If enabled on all services, queries can be federated across multiple tenants. The tenant IDs involved need to be specified separated by a '|' character in the 'X-Scope-OrgID' header.
  -tenant-federation.max-concurrent int

Any sample or exemplar will be rejected if its timestamp is greater than '(now + grace_period)'. This configuration is enforced in the distributor, ingester and query-frontend (to avoid querying too far into the future). (default 10m)
  -validation.enforce-metadata-metric-name
    	Enforce every metadata has a metric name. (default true)
  -validation.max-label-names-per-series int
    	Maximum number of label names per series. (default 30)
  -validation.max-length-label-name int
    	Maximum length accepted for label names (default 1024)
  -validation.max-length-label-value int
    	Maximum length accepted for label value. This setting also applies to the metric name (default 2048)
  -validation.max-metadata-length int
    	Maximum length accepted for metric metadata. Metadata refers to Metric Name, HELP and UNIT. Longer metadata is dropped except for HELP which is truncated. (default 1024)
  -validation.max-native-histogram-buckets int
    	Maximum number of buckets per native histogram sample. 0 to disable the limit.
  -validation.reduce-native-histogram-over-max-buckets
    	Whether to reduce or reject native histogram samples with more buckets than the configured limit. (default true)
  -validation.separate-metrics-group-label string
    	[experimental] Label used to define the group label for metrics separation. For each write request, the group is obtained from the first non-empty group label from the first timeseries in the incoming list of timeseries. Specific distributor and ingester metrics will be further separated adding a 'group' label with group label's value. Currently applies to the following metrics: cortex_discarded_samples_total
