// QueuingAlgorithm represents the set of operations specific to different approaches to queuing/dequeuing. It is

	// passed to enqueue functions are allowed to contain node names for nodes which do not yet exist; in those cases,
	// we create the missing nodes. Implementers are responsible for adding the newly-created node to whatever state(s)

	// addition of a new node.

	// the node which an element will be dequeued from next, as well as a bool representing whether the passed node
	// and all its children have been checked for dequeue-ability. The returned node may be one of the following:
	//	- the given node: this triggers the base case for the recursive Node.dequeue, and results in dequeuing from
	//    the node's local queue.
	//	- a direct child of the given node: this continues the dequeue recursion.
	// The Tree uses the bool returned to determine when no dequeue-able value can be found at this child. If all
	// children in the subtree have been checked, but no dequeue-able value is found, the Tree traverses to the next
	// child in the given node's order. dequeueSelectNode does *not* update any Node fields.

	// to the next node to dequeue from.
