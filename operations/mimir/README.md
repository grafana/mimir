# Jsonnet for Grafana Mimir on Kubernetes

This folder contains the Jsonnet for deploying Grafana Mimir in Kubernetes.
The documentation for the Mimir Jsonnet is published at [https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/next/operators-guide/deploy-grafana-mimir/jsonnet/](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/next/operators-guide/deploy-grafana-mimir/jsonnet/).

## Contributing

When submitting a PR, CI will enforce that the files in `operations/mimir-tests` match the output generated by the jsonnet in this directory.
Run `make build-jsonnet-tests` to update the compiled jsonnet configurations, and commit the results after verifying they look as expected.

CI will also enforce that the Helm chart has been updated to match jsonnet to a certain degree.
Please see the dedicated "[Contributing to Grafana Mimir helm chart](contributing-to-helm-chart.md)" page for more information about that process.
