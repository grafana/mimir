# These values configure the Grafana Mimir or Grafana Enterprise Metrics cluster to
# handle production ingestion of ~1M active series using the blocks
# storage engine scraped with a 15s interval.
# Query requirements can vary dramatically depending on query rate and query
# ranges. The values here satisfy a "usual" query load as seen from our
# production clusters at this scale.
# It is important to ensure that you run no more than one ingester replica
# per node so that a single node failure does not cause data loss. Zone aware
# replication can be configured to ensure data replication spans availability
# zones. Refer to [Zone Aware Replication](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.0.x/operators-guide/configuring/configuring-zone-aware-replication/)
# for more information.
# Minio is no longer enabled and you are encouraged to use your cloud providers
# object storage service for production deployments.
# Ingesters are configured with a replication factor of 3 to ensure that a single ingester failur does not
# result in data loss.
