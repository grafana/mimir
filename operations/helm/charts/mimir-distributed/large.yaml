# These values configure the Grafana Mimir or Grafana Enterprise Metrics cluster
# for a more production-ready setup. The setup targets 70% CPU and memory utilization
# so that the cluster has room to grow. The resource requests reflect 70% utilization
# and the limits reflect 100% utilization. The values do not set CPU limits,
# because CPU limits have caused severe issues elsewhere, so we don't apply any in our helm chart:
# see https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/
# If you require CPU limits for billing purposes see capped-large.yaml
#
# These values are suitable for ingestion of ~10M series and scrape interval of 15s.
# This implies ingestion rate of around 660000 samples per second.
#
# Query requirements can vary dramatically depending on query rate and query
# ranges. The values here satisfy a "usual" query load of around 50 queries per second
# as seen from our production clusters at this scale.
#
# The values in this file also add podAntiAffinity rules for ingesters and store-gateways.
# The rules ensure that the replicas of the same component are not scheduled on the same
# Kubernetes Node. Zone-aware replication is enabled by default on new installation.
# Refer to [Migrate from single zone to zone-aware replication with Helm](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/migration-guide/migrating-from-single-zone-with-helm) and
# [Zone-Aware Replication](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/operators-guide/configure/configure-zone-aware-replication/)
# for more information.
#
# MinIO is no longer enabled, and you are encouraged to use your cloud providers
# object storage service such as S3 or GCS.
