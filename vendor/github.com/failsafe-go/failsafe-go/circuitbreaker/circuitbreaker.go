/*
CircuitBreaker is a policy that temporarily blocks execution when a configured number of failures are exceeded. Circuit
breakers have three states: closed, open, and half-open. When a circuit breaker is in the ClosedState (default),
executions are allowed. If a configurable number of failures occur, optionally over some time period, the circuit
breaker transitions to OpenState. In the OpenState a circuit breaker will fail executions with ErrOpen.
After a configurable delay, the circuit breaker will transition to HalfOpenState. In the HalfOpenState a configurable
number of trial executions will be allowed, after which the circuit breaker will transition to either ClosedState or
OpenState depending on how many were successful.

A circuit breaker can be count based or time based:

  - Count based circuit breakers will transition between states when recent execution results exceed a threshold.
  - Time based circuit breakers will transition between states when recent execution results exceed a threshold within a time
    period. A minimum number of executions must be performed in order for a state transition to occur. Time based circuit breakers
    use a sliding window to aggregate execution results. The window is divided into 10 time slices, each representing 1/10th
    of the failureThresholdingPeriod. As time progresses, statistics for old time slices are gradually discarded, which
    smoothes the calculation of success and failure rates.

This type is concurrency safe.
