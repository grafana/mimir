/*
FailurePolicyBuilder builds a Policy that allows configurable conditions to determine whether an execution is a failure.
  - By default, any error is considered a failure and will be handled by the policy. You can override this by specifying
    your own handle conditions. The default error handling condition will only be overridden by another condition that
    handles errors such as Handle or HandleIf. Specifying a condition that only handles results, such as HandleResult
    will not replace the default error handling condition.
  - If multiple handle conditions are specified, any condition that matches an execution result or error will trigger
    policy handling.
