### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Deprecates the `v1` API. All `v1` API endpoints now respond with a JSON deprecation notice and a status code of `410`. All endpoints have a `v2` equivalent. The list of endpoints is: #7103
  * `<alertmanager-web.external-url>/api/v1/alerts`
  * `<alertmanager-web.external-url>/api/v1/receivers`
  * `<alertmanager-web.external-url>/api/v1/silence/{id}`
  * `<alertmanager-web.external-url>/api/v1/silences`
  * `<alertmanager-web.external-url>/api/v1/status`
* [CHANGE] Ingester: Increase default value of `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` to 100 MiB (previous default value was 10 MiB). #6764
* [CHANGE] Validate tenant IDs according to [documented behavior](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/configure/about-tenant-ids/) even when tenant federation is not enabled. Note that this will cause some previously accepted tenant IDs to be rejected such as those longer than 150 bytes or containing `|` characters. #6959
* [CHANGE] Ruler: don't use backoff retry on remote evaluation in case of `4xx` errors. #7004
* [CHANGE] Server: responses with HTTP 4xx status codes are now treated as errors and used in `status_code` label of request duration metric. #7045
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: change default for `-memberlist.stream-timeout` from `10s` to `2s`. #7076
* [CHANGE] Memcached: remove legacy `thanos_cache_memcached_*` and `thanos_memcached_*` prefixed metrics. Instead, Memcached and Redis cache clients now emit `thanos_cache_*` prefixed metrics with a `backend` label. #7076
* [CHANGE] Ruler: the following metrics, exposed when the ruler is configured to discover Alertmanager instances via service discovery, have been renamed: #7057
  * `prometheus_sd_failed_configs` renamed to `cortex_prometheus_sd_failed_configs`

* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: the default value for `-query-frontend.not-running-timeout` has been changed from 0 (disabled) to 2s. The configuration option has also been moved from "experimental" to "advanced". #7126
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: to reduce disk contention on HDDs the default value for `blocks-storage.bucket-store.tenant-sync-concurrency` has been changed from `10` to `1` and the default value for `blocks-storage.bucket-store.block-sync-concurrency` has been changed from `20` to `4`. #7136
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Remove deprecated CLI flags `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-lazy-loading-enabled` and `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-lazy-loading-idle-timeout` and their corresponding YAML settings. Instead, use `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.lazy-loading-enabled` and `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.lazy-loading-idle-timeout`. #7521
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Mark experimental CLI flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.lazy-loading-concurrency` and its corresponding YAML settings as advanced. #7521

To ensure backwards compatibility, during a migration from a version prior to 2.11.0 to 2.12 or later, `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors` should be set to `false`. Once all the components are migrated, the flag can be removed.   #7151

## 2.11.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] The following deprecated configurations have been removed: #6673 #6779 #6808 #6814
  * `-querier.iterators`
  * `-querier.batch-iterators`
  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-chunk-pool-bytes`
  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-min-bucket-size-bytes`
  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-max-bucket-size-bytes`
  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled`
* [CHANGE] Querier: Split worker GRPC config into separate client configs for the frontend and scheduler to allow TLS to be configured correctly when specifying the `tls_server_name`. The GRPC config specified under `-querier.frontend-client.*` will no longer apply to the scheduler client, and will need to be set explicitly under `-querier.scheduler-client.*`. #6445 #6573
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: enable sparse index headers by default. Sparse index headers reduce the time to load an index header up to 90%. #6005
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: lazy-loading concurrency limit default value is now 4. #6004
* [CHANGE] General: enabled `-log.buffered` by default. The `-log.buffered` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.13. #6131
* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default `-blocks-storage.tsdb.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes` setting from `1GB` to `350MB`. The new default cache size is enough to store the hashes for all series in a ingester, assuming up to 2M in-memory series per ingester and using the default 13h retention period for local TSDB blocks in the ingesters. #6130
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: removed `cortex_query_frontend_workers_enqueued_requests_total`. Use `cortex_query_frontend_enqueue_duration_seconds_count` instead. #6121
* [CHANGE] Ingester / querier: enable ingester to querier chunks streaming by default and mark it as stable. #6174
* [CHANGE] Ingester / querier: enable ingester query request minimisation by default and mark it as stable. #6174
* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed the default value for the experimental configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.early-head-compaction-min-estimated-series-reduction-percentage` from 10 to 15. #6186
* [CHANGE] Ingester: `/ingester/push` HTTP endpoint has been removed. This endpoint was added for testing and troubleshooting, but was never documented or used for anything. #6299
* [CHANGE] Experimental setting `-log.rate-limit-logs-per-second-burst` renamed to `-log.rate-limit-logs-burst-size`. #6230
* [CHANGE] Distributor: instead of errors with HTTP status codes, `Push()` now returns errors with gRPC codes: #6377
  * `http.StatusAccepted` (202) code is replaced with `codes.AlreadyExists`.
  * `http.BadRequest` (400) code is replaced with `codes.FailedPrecondition`.
  * `http.StatusTooManyRequests` (429) and the non-standard `529` (The service is overloaded) codes are replaced with `codes.ResourceExhausted`.
* [CHANGE] Ingester: by setting the newly introduced experimental CLI flag `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors` to true, ingester will return only gRPC errors. This feature changes the following status codes: #6443 #6680 #6723
  * `http.StatusBadRequest` (400) is replaced with `codes.FailedPrecondition` on the write path.
  * `http.StatusServiceUnavailable` (503) is replaced with `codes.Internal` on the write path, and with `codes.ResourceExhausted` on the read path.
  * `codes.Unknown` is replaced with `codes.Internal` on both write and read path.
* [CHANGE] Upgrade Node.js to v20. #6540
* [CHANGE] Querier: `cortex_querier_blocks_consistency_checks_failed_total` is now incremented when a block couldn't be queried from any attempted store-gateway as opposed to incremented after each attempt. Also `cortex_querier_blocks_consistency_checks_total` is incremented once per query as opposed to once per attempt (with 3 attempts). #6590
* [CHANGE] Ingester: Modify utilization based read path limiter to base memory usage on Go heap size. #6584
* [FEATURE] Distributor: added option `-distributor.retry-after-header.enabled` to include the `Retry-After` header in recoverable error responses. #6608
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: add experimental support for query blocking. Queries are blocked on a per-tenant basis and is configured via the limit `blocked_queries`. #5609
* [FEATURE] Vault: Added support for new Vault authentication methods: `AppRole`, `Kubernetes`, `UserPass` and `Token`. #6143
* [FEATURE] Add experimental endpoint `/api/v1/cardinality/active_series` to return the set of active series for a given selector. #6536 #6619 #6651 #6667 #6717
* [FEATURE] Added `-<prefix>.s3.part-size` flag to configure the S3 minimum file size in bytes used for multipart uploads. #6592
* [FEATURE] Add the experimental `-<prefix>.s3.send-content-md5` flag (defaults to `false`) to configure S3 Put Object requests to send a `Content-MD5` header. Setting this flag is not recommended unless your object storage does not support checksums. #6622
* [FEATURE] Distributor: add an experimental flag `-distributor.reusable-ingester-push-worker` that can be used to pre-allocate a pool of workers to be used to send push requests to the ingesters. #6660
* [FEATURE] Distributor: Support enabling of automatically generated name suffixes for metrics ingested via OTLP, through the flag `-distributor.otel-metric-suffixes-enabled`. #6542
* [FEATURE] Ingester: ingester can now track which of the user's series the ingester actually owns according to the ring, and only consider owned series when checking for user series limit. This helps to avoid hitting the user's series limit when scaling up ingesters or changing user's ingester shard size. Feature is currently experimental, and disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting `-ingester.use-ingester-owned-series-for-limits` (to use owned series for limiting). This is currently limited to multi-zone ingester setup, with replication factor being equal to number of zones. #6718 #7087
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: don't treat cancel as an error. #4648
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: exported summary `cortex_ingester_inflight_push_requests_summary` tracking total number of inflight requests in percentile buckets. #5845
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: add `cortex_query_scheduler_enqueue_duration_seconds` metric that records the time taken to enqueue or reject a query request. #5879
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add `cortex_query_frontend_enqueue_duration_seconds` metric that records the time taken to enqueue or reject a query request. When query-scheduler is in use, the metric has the `scheduler_address` label to differentiate the enqueue duration by query-scheduler backend. #5879 #6087 #6120
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add metric `cortex_bucket_store_blocks_loaded_by_duration` for counting the loaded number of blocks based on their duration. #6074  #6129

* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add experimental support for storing metadata when ingesting metrics via OTLP. This makes metrics description and type available when ingesting metrics via OTLP. Enable with `-distributor.enable-otlp-metadata-storage=true`. #5693 #6035 #6254
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added support for sampling errors, which can be enabled by setting `-ingester.error-sample-rate`. This way each error will be logged once in the configured number of times. All the discarded samples will still be tracked by the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric. #5584 #6014
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Fetch secrets used to configure TLS on the Alertmanager client from Vault when `-vault.enabled` is true. #5239
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added query-sharding support for `group by` aggregation queries. #6024

* [ENHANCEMENT] Packaging: add logrotate config file. #6142
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: add the experimental configuration options `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` to enforce a limit in bytes on the `PostingsForMatchers()` cache used by ingesters (the cache limit is per TSDB head and block basis, not a global one). The experimental configuration options `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-size` and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-size` have been deprecated. #6151
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: use the `PostingsForMatchers()` in-memory cache for label values queries with matchers too. #6151
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester / store-gateway: optimized regex matchers. #6168 #6250

* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: include corresponding trace ID with log messages associated with rule evaluation. #6379 #6520
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: clarify log messages and span events emitted while querying ingesters, and include both ingester name and address when relevant. #6381
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: introduce new experimental configuration parameters `-<prefix>.memcached.write-buffer-size-bytes` `-<prefix>.memcached.read-buffer-size-bytes` to customise the memcached client write and read buffer size (the buffer is allocated for each memcached connection). #6468
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester, Distributor: added experimental support for rejecting push requests received via gRPC before reading them into memory, if ingester or distributor is unable to accept the request. This is activated by using `-ingester.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` for ingester, and `-distributor.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` for distributor. #5976 #6300
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add capability in store-gateways to accept number of tokens through config. `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.num-tokens`, `default-value=512` #4863
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: return warnings generated during query evaluation. #6391
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add the option `-server.http-read-header-timeout` to enable specifying a timeout for reading HTTP request headers. It defaults to 0, in which case reading of headers can take up to `-server.http-read-timeout`, leaving no time for reading body, if there's any. #6517
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add connection-string option, `-<prefix>.azure.connection-string`, for Azure Blob Storage. #6487
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Add `-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests-bytes`. This limit protects the ingester against requests that together may cause an OOM. #6492
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: add new per-tenant `cortex_ingester_local_limits` metric to expose the calculated local per-tenant limits seen at each ingester. Exports the local per-tenant series limit with label `{limit="max_global_series_per_user"}` #6403
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added "queue_time_seconds" field to "query stats" log. This is total time that query and subqueries spent in the queue, before queriers picked it up. #6537
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` CLI flag to specify whether gRPC status codes should be used in `status_code` label of `cortex_request_duration_seconds` metric. It defaults to false, meaning that successful and erroneous gRPC status codes are represented with `success` and `error` respectively. #6562
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-ingester.client.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` CLI flag to specify whether gRPC status codes should be used in `status_code` label of `cortex_ingester_client_request_duration_seconds` metric. It defaults to false, meaning that successful and erroneous gRPC status codes are represented with `2xx` and `error` respectively. #6562
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.http-log-closed-connections-without-response-enabled` option to log details about connections to HTTP server that were closed before any data was sent back. This can happen if client doesn't manage to send complete HTTP headers before timeout. #6612
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: include length of query, time since the earliest and latest points of a query, time since the earliest and latest points of a query, cached/uncached bytes in "query stats" logs. Time parameters (start/end/time) are always formatted as RFC3339 now. #6473 #6477 #6709 #6710
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: `-query-frontend.align-queries-with-step` has been moved from a global flag to a per-tenant override. #6714
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added support for reducing the resolution of native histogram samples upon ingestion if the sample has too many buckets compared to `-validation.max-native-histogram-buckets`. This is enabled by default and can be turned off by setting `-validation.reduce-native-histogram-over-max-buckets` to `false`. #6535
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: optionally wait for the frontend to complete startup if requests are received while the frontend is still starting. Disabled by default, set `-query-frontend.not-running-timeout` to a non-zero value to enable. #6621
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Include source IPs in OTLP push handler logs. #6652
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: return clearer error message when a query request is received while shutting down. #6675

* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Mark corrupted blocks for no-compaction to avoid blocking compactor future runs. #6588
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added an experimental configuration option `distributor.ingestion-burst-factor` that overrides the `distributor.ingestion-burst-size` option if set. The `distributor.ingestion-burst-factor` is used to set the underlying ingestion rate limiter token bucket's burst size to a multiple of the per distributor `distributor.ingestion-rate-limit` and the `distributor.ingestion-burst-factor`. This is disabled by default. #6662
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add debug message to track tenants sending queries that are not able to benefit from caches. #6732

* [BUGFIX] Packaging: fix preremove script preventing upgrades on RHEL based OS. #6067
* [BUGFIX] Querier: return actual error rather than `attempted to read series at index XXX from stream, but the stream has already been exhausted` (or even no error at all) when streaming chunks from ingesters or store-gateways is enabled and an error occurs while streaming chunks. #6346
* [BUGFIX] Querier: reduce log volume when querying ingesters with zone-awareness enabled and one or more instances in a single zone unavailable. #6381
* [BUGFIX] Querier: don't try to query further ingesters if ingester query request minimization is enabled and a query limit is reached as a result of the responses from the initial set of ingesters. #6402
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Don't cache context cancellation error when querying. #6446
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: don't ignore errors encountered while iterating through chunks or samples in response to a query request. #6469

* [CHANGE] Querier: `-query-frontend.cache-unaligned-requests` has been moved from a global flag to a per-tenant override. #5312
* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed `cortex_ingester_shipper_dir_syncs_total` and `cortex_ingester_shipper_dir_sync_failures_total` metrics. The former metric was not much useful, and the latter was never incremented. #5396
* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed logging of errors related to hitting per-instance limits to reduce resource usage when ingesters are under pressure. #5585
* [CHANGE] gRPC clients: use default connect timeout of 5s, and therefore enable default connect backoff max delay of 5s. #5562
* [CHANGE] Ingester: the `-validation.create-grace-period` is now enforced in the ingester too, other than distributor and query-frontend. If you've configured `-validation.create-grace-period` then make sure the configuration is applied to ingesters too. #5712
* [CHANGE] Distributor: the `-validation.create-grace-period` is now enforced for examplars too in the distributor. If an examplar has timestamp greater than "now + grace_period", then the exemplar will be dropped and the metric `cortex_discarded_exemplars_total{reason="exemplar_too_far_in_future",user="..."}` increased. #5761
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: the `-validation.create-grace-period` is now enforced in the query-frontend even when the configured value is 0. When the value is 0, the query end time range is truncated to the current real-world time. #5829

* [FEATURE] Cardinality API: added a new `count_method` parameter which enables counting active series. #5136
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: added experimental support to cache cardinality, label names and label values query responses. The cache will be used when `-query-frontend.cache-results` is enabled, and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-cardinality-query` or `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-labels-query` set to a value greater than 0. The following metrics have been added to track the query results cache hit ratio per `request_type`: #5212 #5235 #5426 #5524
  * `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_requests_total{request_type="query_range|cardinality|label_names_and_values"}`
  * `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_hits_total{request_type="query_range|cardinality|label_names_and_values"}`
* [FEATURE] Added `-<prefix>.s3.list-objects-version` flag to configure the S3 list objects version. #5099
* [FEATURE] Ingester: add optional CPU/memory utilization based read request limiting, considered experimental. Disabled by default, enable by configuring limits via both of the following flags: #5012 #5392 #5394 #5526 #5508 #5704
  * `-ingester.read-path-cpu-utilization-limit`
  * `-ingester.read-path-memory-utilization-limit`
  * `-ingester.log-utilization-based-limiter-cpu-samples`
* [FEATURE] Ruler: support filtering results from rule status endpoint by `file`, `rule_group` and `rule_name`. #5291
* [FEATURE] Ingester: add experimental support for creating tokens by using spread minimizing strategy. This can be enabled with `-ingester.ring.token-generation-strategy: spread-minimizing` and `-ingester.ring.spread-minimizing-zones: <all available zones>`. In that case `-ingester.ring.tokens-file-path` must be empty. #5308 #5324

* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add a `stage` label to the metric `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_touched`. This label now applies to `data_type="chunks"` and `data_type="series"`. The `stage` label has 2 values: `processed` - the number of series that parsed - and `returned` - the number of series selected from the processed bytes to satisfy the query. #4797 #4830
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: make `__meta_tenant_id` label available in relabeling rules configured via `metric_relabel_configs`. #4725
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added the configurable limit `compactor.block-upload-max-block-size-bytes` or `compactor_block_upload_max_block_size_bytes` to limit the byte size of uploaded or validated blocks. #4680
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: reduce CPU utilisation when shuffle sharding is enabled with large shard sizes. #4851
* [ENHANCEMENT] Packaging: facilitate configuration management by instructing systemd to start mimir with a configuration file. #4810
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: reduce memory allocations when looking up postings from cache. #4861 #4869 #4962 #5047
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: retain only necessary bytes when reading series from the bucket. #4926
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester, store-gateway: clear the shutdown marker after a successful shutdown to enable reusing their persistent volumes in case the ingester or store-gateway is restarted. #4985
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway, query-frontend: Reduced memory allocations when looking up cached entries from Memcached. #4862
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add additional template function `queryFromGeneratorURL` returning query URL decoded query from the `GeneratorURL` field of an alert. #4301
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added experimental ruler storage cache support. The cache should reduce the number of "list objects" API calls issued to the object storage when there are 2+ ruler replicas running in a Mimir cluster. The cache can be configured setting `-ruler-storage.cache.*` CLI flags or their respective YAML config options. #4950 #5054
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added HTTP `/store-gateway/prepare-shutdown` endpoint for gracefully scaling down of store-gateways. A gauge `cortex_store_gateway_prepare_shutdown_requested` has been introduced for tracing this process. #4955
* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated Kuberesolver dependency (github.com/sercand/kuberesolver) from v2.4.0 to v4.0.0 and gRPC dependency (google.golang.org/grpc) from v1.47.0 to v1.53.0. #4922
* [ENHANCEMENT] Introduced new options for logging HTTP request headers: `-server.log-request-headers` enables logging HTTP request headers, `-server.log-request-headers-exclude-list` lists headers which should not be logged. #4922
* [ENHANCEMENT] Block upload: `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/files` endpoint now disables read and write HTTP timeout, overriding `-server.http-read-timeout` and `-server.http-write-timeout` values. This is done to allow large file uploads to succeed. #4956
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Introduce new metrics from upstream. #4918
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_failed_total` (added `reason` label)
  * `cortex_alertmanager_nflog_maintenance_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_nflog_maintenance_errors_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_silences_maintenance_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_silences_maintenance_errors_total`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add native histogram support for `cortex_request_duration_seconds` metric family. #4987
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: do not list rule groups in the object storage for disabled tenants. #5004
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend and querier: add HTTP API endpoint `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/format_query` to format a PromQL query. #4373
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_frontend_regexp_matcher_count` and `cortex_query_frontend_regexp_matcher_optimized_count` metrics to track optimization of regular expression label matchers. #4813
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add configuration option to enable or disable the deletion of alertmanager state from object storage. This is useful when migrating alertmanager tenants from one cluster to another, because it avoids a condition where the state object is copied but then deleted before the configuration object is copied. #4989
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: only use the minimum set of chunks from ingesters when querying, and cancel unnecessary requests to ingesters sooner if we know their results won't be used. #5016
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `-enable-go-runtime-metrics` flag to expose all go runtime metrics as Prometheus metrics. #5009
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: trigger a synchronization of tenant's rule groups as soon as they change the rules configuration via API. This synchronization is in addition of the periodic syncing done every `-ruler.poll-interval`. The new behavior is enabled by default, but can be disabled with `-ruler.sync-rules-on-changes-enabled=false` (configurable on a per-tenant basis too). If you disable the new behaviour, then you may want to revert `-ruler.poll-interval` to `1m`. #4975 #5053 #5115 #5170
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Improve invalid tenant shard size error message. #5024
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: record index header loading time separately in `cortex_bucket_store_series_request_stage_duration_seconds{stage="load_index_header"}`. Now index header loading will be visible in the "Mimir / Queries" dashboard in the "Series request p99/average latency" panels. #5011 #5062
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and ingester: add experimental support for streaming chunks from ingesters to queriers while evaluating queries. This can be enabled with `-querier.prefer-streaming-chunks=true`. #4886 #5078 #5094 #5126
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.17.3` to `alpine:3.18.0`. #5065
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: reduced the number of "object exists" API calls issued by the compactor to the object storage when syncing block's `meta.json` files. #5063
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Push request rate limits (`-distributor.request-rate-limit` and `-distributor.request-burst-size`) and their associated YAML configuration are now stable. #5124
* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to 1.20.5. #5185
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update alpine base image to 3.18.2. #5274 #5276
* [BUGFIX] Metadata API: Mimir will now return an empty object when no metadata is available, matching Prometheus. #4782
* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: add collision detection on expanded postings and individual postings cache keys. #4770
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Support the `type=alert|record` query parameter for the API endpoint `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/rules`. #4302
* [BUGFIX] Backend: Check that alertmanager's data-dir doesn't overlap with bucket-sync dir. #4921
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Allow to rate-limit webex, telegram and discord notifications. #4979
* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: panics when decoding LabelValues responses that contain more than 655360 values. These responses are no longer cached. #5021
* [BUGFIX] Querier: don't leak memory when processing query requests from query-frontends (ie. when the query-scheduler is disabled). #5199

### Documentation

* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve `MimirIngesterReachingTenantsLimit` runbook. #4744 #4752
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `symbol table size exceeds` case to `MimirCompactorHasNotSuccessfullyRunCompaction` runbook. #4945
* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify which APIs use query sharding. #4948

### Mixin

* [CHANGE] Alerts: Remove `MimirQuerierHighRefetchRate`. #4980
* [CHANGE] Alerts: Remove `MimirTenantHasPartialBlocks`. This is obsoleted by the changed default of `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` to `1d`, which will auto remediate this alert. #5026
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager dashboard: display active aggregation groups #4772
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: `MimirIngesterTSDBWALCorrupted` now only fires when there are more than one corrupted WALs in single-zone deployments and when there are more than two zones affected in multi-zone deployments. #4920
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: added labels to duplicated `MimirRolloutStuck` and `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` rules in order to distinguish them. #5023
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: fix holes in graph for lightly loaded clusters #4915
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: allow configuring additional services for the Rollout Progress dashboard. #5007
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: do not fire `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` alert for any matching container outside of namespaces where Mimir is running. #5089
* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: show cancelled requests in a different color to successful requests in throughput panels on dashboards. #5039
* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix dashboard panels that showed percentages with axes from 0 to 10000%. #5084
* [BUGFIX] Remove dependency on upstream Kubernetes mixin. #4732

### Jsonnet

* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed ruler autoscaling policy, extended scale down period from 60s to 600s. #4786
* [CHANGE] Update to v0.5.0 rollout-operator. #4893
* [CHANGE] Backend: add `alertmanager_args` to `mimir-backend` when running in read-write deployment mode. Remove hardcoded `filesystem` alertmanager storage. This moves alertmanager's data-dir to `/data/alertmanager` by default. #4907 #4921
* [CHANGE] Remove `-pdb` suffix from `PodDisruptionBudget` names. This will create new `PodDisruptionBudget` resources. Make sure to prune the old resources; otherwise, rollouts will be blocked. #5109
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: enable query sharding for cardinality estimation via `-query-frontend.query-sharding-target-series-per-shard` by default if the results cache is enabled. #5128
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: configure `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval=15m` to spread TSDB head compaction over a wider time range. #4870
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: configure `-blocks-storage.tsdb.wal-replay-concurrency` to CPU request minus 1. #4864
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: configure `-compactor.first-level-compaction-wait-period` to TSDB head compaction interval plus 10 minutes. #4872
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: set `GOMEMLIMIT` to the memory request value. This should reduce the likelihood the store-gateway may go out of memory, at the cost of an higher CPU utilization due to more frequent garbage collections when the memory utilization gets closer or above the configured requested memory. #4971
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: dynamically set `GOMAXPROCS` based on the CPU request. This should reduce the likelihood a high load on the store-gateway will slow down the entire Kubernetes node. #5104
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `store_gateway_lazy_loading_enabled` configuration option which combines disabled lazy-loading and reducing blocks sync concurrency. Reducing blocks sync concurrency improves startup times with disabled lazy loading on HDDs. #5025
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `rollout-operator` image to `v0.6.0`. #5155
* [BUGFIX] Backend: configure `-ruler.alertmanager-url` to `mimir-backend` when running in read-write deployment mode. #4892
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: don't overwrite upsteam memcached statefulset jsonnet to allow chosing between antiAffinity and topologySpreadConstraints.

### Mimirtool

* [CHANGE] check rules: will fail on duplicate rules when `--strict` is provided. #5035
* [FEATURE] sync/diff can now include/exclude namespaces based on a regular expression using `--namespaces-regex` and `--ignore-namespaces-regex`. #5100
* [ENHANCEMENT] analyze prometheus: allow to specify `-prometheus-http-prefix`. #4966
* [ENHANCEMENT] analyze grafana: allow to specify `--folder-title` to limit dashboards analysis based on their exact folder title. #4973

### Tools

* [CHANGE] copyblocks: copying between Azure Blob Storage buckets is now supported in addition to copying between Google Cloud Storage buckets. As a result, the `--service` flag is now required to be specified (accepted values are `gcs` or `abs`). #4756

## 2.8.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: The following metrics have been removed: #4332
  * `cortex_bucket_store_series_get_all_duration_seconds`
  * `cortex_bucket_store_series_merge_duration_seconds`
* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default value of `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` from `24h` to `13h`. If you're running Mimir with a custom configuration and you're overriding `-querier.query-store-after` to a value greater than the default `12h` then you should increase `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` accordingly. #4382
* [CHANGE] Ingester: the configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-tsdb-opening-concurrency-on-startup` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.10. #4445
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Cached results now contain timestamp which allows Mimir to check if cached results are still valid based on current TTL configured for tenant. Results cached by previous Mimir version are used until they expire from cache, which can take up to 7 days. If you need to use per-tenant TTL sooner, please flush results cache manually. #4439
* [CHANGE] Ingester: the `cortex_ingester_tsdb_wal_replay_duration_seconds` metrics has been removed. #4465
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend and ruler: use protobuf internal query result payload format by default. This feature is no longer considered experimental. #4557 #4709
* [CHANGE] Ruler: reject creating federated rule groups while tenant federation is disabled. Previously the rule groups would be silently dropped during bucket sync. #4555
* [CHANGE] Compactor: the `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/finish` endpoint now returns a `429` status code when the compactor has reached the limit specified by `-compactor.max-block-upload-validation-concurrency`. #4598
* [CHANGE] Compactor: when starting a block upload the maximum byte size of the block metadata provided in the request body is now limited to 1 MiB. If this limit is exceeded a `413` status code is returned. #4683
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: cache key format for expanded postings has changed. This will invalidate the expanded postings in the index cache when deployed. #4667
* [FEATURE] Cache: Introduce experimental support for using Redis for results, chunks, index, and metadata caches. #4371
* [FEATURE] Vault: Introduce experimental integration with Vault to fetch secrets used to configure TLS for clients. Server TLS secrets will still be read from a file. `tls-ca-path`, `tls-cert-path` and `tls-key-path` will denote the path in Vault for the following CLI flags when `-vault.enabled` is true: #4446.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added experimental configuration parameter `-compactor.first-level-compaction-wait-period`, to configure how long the compactor should wait before compacting 1st level blocks (uploaded by ingesters). This configuration option allows to reduce the chances compactor begins compacting blocks before all ingesters have uploaded their blocks to the storage. #4401
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use more efficient chunks fetching and caching. #4255
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend and ruler: add experimental, more performant protobuf internal query result response format enabled with `-ruler.query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf`. #4331

* [ENHANCEMENT] Optimized regular expression label matchers with alternates (e.g. `a|b|c`). #4647
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added an in-memory cache for regular expression matchers, to avoid parsing and compiling the same expression multiple times when used in recurring queries. #4633
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: results cache TTL is now configurable by using `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl` and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-out-of-order-time-window` options. These values can also be specified per tenant. Default values are unchanged (7 days and 10 minutes respectively). #4385
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added advanced configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.wal-replay-concurrency` representing the maximum number of CPUs used during WAL replay. #4445
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added metrics `cortex_ingester_tsdb_open_duration_seconds_total` to measure the total time it takes to open all existing TSDBs. The time tracked by this metric also includes the TSDBs WAL replay duration. #4465
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use streaming implementation for LabelNames RPC. The batch size for streaming is controlled by `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size`. #4464
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: Add support for TLS or mTLS connections to cache servers. #4535
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: blocks index files are now validated for correctness for blocks uploaded via the TSDB block upload feature. #4503

* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: validation of blocks uploaded via the TSDB block upload feature is now configurable on a per tenant basis: #4585
  * `-compactor.block-upload-validation-enabled` has been added, `compactor_block_upload_validation_enabled` can be used to override per tenant
  * `-compactor.block-upload.block-validation-enabled` was the previous global flag and has been removed
* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB Block Upload: block upload validation concurrency can now be limited with `-compactor.max-block-upload-validation-concurrency`. #4598
* [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: Add support for converting OTel exponential histograms to Prometheus native histograms. The ingestion of native histograms must be enabled, please set `-ingester.native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` to `true`. #4063 #4639
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add metric `cortex_query_fetched_index_bytes_total` to measure TSDB index bytes fetched to execute a query. #4597
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add experimental limit to enforce a max query expression size in bytes via `-query-frontend.max-query-expression-size-bytes` or `max_query_expression_size_bytes`. #4604

### Mixin

* [ENHANCEMENT] Queries: Display data touched per sec in bytes instead of number of items. #4492
* [ENHANCEMENT] `_config.job_names.<job>` values can now be arrays of regular expressions in addition to a single string. Strings are still supported and behave as before. #4543
* [ENHANCEMENT] Queries dashboard: remove mention to store-gateway "streaming enabled" in panels because store-gateway only support streaming series since Mimir 2.7. #4569
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add panel description for Read QPS panel in Ruler dashboard to explain values when in remote ruler mode. #4675
* [BUGFIX] Ruler dashboard: show data for reads from ingesters. #4543

### Jsonnet

* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed ruler deployment max surge from `0` to `50%`, and max unavailable from `1` to `0`. #4381
* [CHANGE] Memcached connections parameters `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections`, `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections` and `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.metadata-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections` settings are now configured based on `max-get-multi-concurrency` and `max-async-concurrency`. #4591
* [CHANGE] Add support to use external Redis as cache. Following are some changes in the jsonnet config: #4386 #4640
  * Renamed `memcached_*_enabled` config options to `cache_*_enabled`
  * Renamed `memcached_*_max_item_size_mb` config options to `cache_*_max_item_size_mb`
  * Added `cache_*_backend` config options
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway StatefulSets with disabled multi-zone deployment are also unregistered from the ring on shutdown. This eliminated resharding during rollouts, at the cost of extra effort during scaling down store-gateways. For more information see [Scaling down store-gateways](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.7.x/operators-guide/run-production-environment/scaling-out/#scaling-down-store-gateways). #4713
* [CHANGE] Removed `$._config.querier.replicas` and `$._config.queryFrontend.replicas`. If you need to customize the number of querier or query-frontend replicas, and autoscaling is disabled, please set an override as is done for other stateless components (e.g. distributors). #5130
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: add `alertmanager_data_disk_size` and  `alertmanager_data_disk_class` configuration options, by default no storage class is set. #4389
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `rollout-operator` to `v0.4.0`. #4524
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update memcached to `memcached:1.6.19-alpine`. #4581
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for mTLS connections to Memcached servers. #4553
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update the `memcached-exporter` to `v0.11.2`. #4570
* [ENHANCEMENT] Autoscaling: Add `autoscaling_query_frontend_memory_target_utilization`, `autoscaling_ruler_query_frontend_memory_target_utilization`, and `autoscaling_ruler_memory_target_utilization` configuration options, for controlling the corresponding autoscaler memory thresholds. Each has a default of 1, i.e. 100%. #4612
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add ability to set per-distributor limits via `distributor_instance_limits` using runtime configuration. #4627
* [BUGFIX] Add missing query sharding settings for user_24M and user_32M plans. #4374

### Mimirtool

* [ENHANCEMENT] Backfill: mimirtool will now sleep and retry if it receives a 429 response while trying to finish an upload due to validation concurrency limits. #4598
* [ENHANCEMENT] `gauge` panel type is supported now in `mimirtool analyze dashboard`. #4679
* [ENHANCEMENT] Set a `User-Agent` header on requests to Mimir or Prometheus servers. #4700

### Mimir Continuous Test

* [FEATURE] Allow continuous testing of native histograms as well by enabling the flag `-tests.write-read-series-test.histogram-samples-enabled`. The metrics exposed by the tool will now have a new label called `type` with possible values of `float`, `histogram_float_counter`, `histogram_float_gauge`, `histogram_int_counter`, `histogram_int_gauge`, the list of metrics impacted: #4457
  * `mimir_continuous_test_writes_total`
  * `mimir_continuous_test_writes_failed_total`
  * `mimir_continuous_test_queries_total`
  * `mimir_continuous_test_queries_failed_total`
  * `mimir_continuous_test_query_result_checks_total`
  * `mimir_continuous_test_query_result_checks_failed_total`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a new metric `mimir_continuous_test_build_info` that reports version information, similar to the existing `cortex_build_info` metric exposed by other Mimir components. #4712
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add coherency for the selected ranges and instants of test queries. #4704

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Ingester: the configuration parameter `-ingester.ring.readiness-check-ring-health` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.9. #4422
* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed default value of `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration` option from 0 to 1m. #4250
* [CHANGE] Querier: Errors with status code `422` coming from the store-gateway are propagated and not converted to the consistency check error anymore. #4100
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: When a query hits `max_fetched_chunks_per_query` and `max_fetched_series_per_query` limits, an error with the status code `422` is created and returned. #4056
* [CHANGE] Packaging: Migrate FPM packaging solution to NFPM. Rationalize packages dependencies and add package for all binaries. #3911
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Deprecate flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.subrange-size` since there's no benefit to changing the default of `16000`. #4135

  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_samples`
  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_series`
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: use mmap-less index-header reader by default and remove mmap-based index header reader. The following flags have changed: #4280
   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled` has been removed
   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-enabled` has been removed
   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-max-idle-file-handles` has been renamed to `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.max-idle-file-handles`, and the corresponding configuration file option has been renamed from `stream_reader_max_idle_file_handles` to `max_idle_file_handles`
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: the streaming store-gateway is now enabled by default. The new default setting for `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` is `5000`. #4330

* [FEATURE] Ruler: added `keep_firing_for` support to alerting rules. #4099
* [FEATURE] Distributor, ingester: ingestion of native histograms. The new per-tenant limit `-ingester.native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` controls whether native histograms are stored or ignored. #4159
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Introduce experimental `-query-frontend.query-sharding-target-series-per-shard` to allow query sharding to take into account cardinality of similar requests executed previously. This feature uses the same cache that's used for results caching. #4121 #4177 #4188 #4254
* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: update go to 1.20.1. #4266
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added `out_of_order_blocks_external_label_enabled` shipper option to label out-of-order blocks before shipping them to cloud storage. #4182 #4297
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: introduced concurrency when loading per-tenant rules configuration. This improvement is expected to speed up the ruler start up time in a Mimir cluster with a large number of tenants. #4258
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Add `reason` label to `cortex_compactor_runs_failed_total`. The value can be `shutdown` or `error`. #4012
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: enforce `max_fetched_series_per_query`. #4056
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Disambiguate logs for failed queries. #4067
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: log caller user agent in query stats logs. #4093
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `data_type` label with values on `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_extended_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_bytes_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_bytes_total` for `postings`, `series`, and `chunks`. #4095
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Reduce memory allocation rate when loading TSDB chunks from Memcached. #4074
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: track `cortex_frontend_query_response_codec_duration_seconds` and `cortex_frontend_query_response_codec_payload_bytes` metrics to measure the time taken and bytes read / written while encoding and decoding query result payloads. #4110
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: expose additional upstream metrics `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_groups`, `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_alert_processing_duration_seconds`. #4151
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and query-frontend: add experimental, more performant protobuf internal query result response format enabled with `-query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf`. #4153
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use more efficient chunks fetching and caching. This should reduce CPU, memory utilization, and receive bandwidth of a store-gateway. Enable with `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.fine-grained-chunks-caching-enabled=true`. #4163 #4174 #4227
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Wait for in-flight queries to finish before shutting down. #4073 #4170
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `encode` and `other` stage to `cortex_bucket_store_series_request_stage_duration_seconds` metric. #4179
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: log state of TSDB when shipping or forced compaction can't be done due to unexpected state of TSDB. #4211
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.17.1` to `alpine:3.17.2`. #4240
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add a `stage` label to the metrics `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_fetched`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_size_fetched_bytes`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_touched`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_size_touched_bytes`. This label only applies to `data_type="chunks"`. For `fetched` metrics with `data_type="chunks"` the `stage` label has 2 values: `fetched` - the chunks or bytes that were fetched from the cache or the object store, `refetched` - the chunks or bytes that had to be refetched from the cache or the object store because their size was underestimated during the first fetch. For `touched` metrics with `data_type="chunks"` the `stage` label has 2 values: `processed` - the chunks or bytes that were read from the fetched chunks or bytes and were processed in memory, `returned` - the chunks or bytes that were selected from the processed bytes to satisfy the query. #4227 #4316
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: improve the partial block check related to `compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` to potentially issue less requests to object storage. #4246
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: added `-*.memcached.min-idle-connections-headroom-percentage` support to configure the minimum number of idle connections to keep open as a percentage (0-100) of the number of recently used idle connections. This feature is disabled when set to a negative value (default), which means idle connections are kept open indefinitely. #4249
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and store-gateway: optimized regular expression label matchers with case insensitive alternate operator. #4340 #4357
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added the experimental flag `-compactor.block-upload.block-validation-enabled` with the default `true` to configure whether block validation occurs on backfilled blocks. #3411
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: apply a jitter to the first TSDB head compaction interval configured via `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval`. Subsequent checks will happen at the configured interval. This should help to spread the TSDB head compaction among different ingesters over the configured interval. #4364
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: the maximum accepted value for `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval` has been increased from 5m to 15m. #4364
* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: return `Canceled` rather than `Aborted` or `Internal` error when the calling querier cancels a label names or values request, and return `Internal` if processing the request fails for another reason. #4061
* [BUGFIX] Querier: track canceled requests with status code `499` in the metrics instead of `503` or `422`. #4099
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: compact out-of-order data during `/ingester/flush` or when TSDB is idle. #4180
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: conversion of global limits `max-series-per-user`, `max-series-per-metric`, `max-metadata-per-user` and `max-metadata-per-metric` into corresponding local limits now takes into account the number of ingesters in each zone. #4238
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: track `cortex_ingester_memory_series` metric consistently with `cortex_ingester_memory_series_created_total` and `cortex_ingester_memory_series_removed_total`. #4312
* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed a bug which was incorrectly matching series with regular expression label matchers with begin/end anchors in the middle of the regular expression. #4340

* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `-tls-insecure-skip-verify` to rules, alertmanager and backfill commands. #4162

### Query-tee

* [CHANGE] Increase default value of `-backend.read-timeout` to 150s, to accommodate default querier and query frontend timeout of 120s. #4262
* [ENHANCEMENT] Log errors that occur while performing requests to compare two endpoints. #4262
* [ENHANCEMENT] When comparing two responses that both contain an error, only consider the comparison failed if the errors differ. Previously, if either response contained an error, the comparison always failed, even if both responses contained the same error. #4262
* [ENHANCEMENT] Include the value of the `X-Scope-OrgID` header when logging a comparison failure. #4262
* [BUGFIX] Parameters (expression, time range etc.) for a query request where the parameters are in the HTTP request body rather than in the URL are now logged correctly when responses differ. #4265

## 2.6.2

* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.4 to fix CVE-2023-24539, CVE-2023-24540, CVE-2023-29400. #4903

## 2.6.1

### Grafana Mimir

* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.3 to fix CVE-2023-24538 #4798

## 2.6.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Querier: Introduce `-querier.max-partial-query-length` to limit the time range for partial queries at the querier level and deprecate `-store.max-query-length`. #3825 #4017
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Remove experimental `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent-reject-over-limit` flag. #3706
* [CHANGE] Ingester: If shipping is enabled block retention will now be relative to the upload time to cloud storage. If shipping is disabled block retention will be relative to the creation time of the block instead of the mintime of the last block created. #3816
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Deprecated CLI flag `-query-frontend.align-querier-with-step` has been removed. #3982
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: added default configuration for `-alertmanager.configs.fallback`. Allows tenants to send alerts without first uploading an Alertmanager configuration. #3541
* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: streaming of series. The store-gateway can now stream results back to the querier instead of buffering them. This is expected to greatly reduce peak memory consumption while keeping latency the same. You can enable this feature by setting `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` to a value in the high thousands (5000-10000). This is still an experimental feature and is subject to a changing API and instability. #3540 #3546 #3587 #3606 #3611 #3620 #3645 #3355 #3697 #3666 #3687 #3728 #3739 #3751 #3779 #3839
* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added support for the Webex receiver. #3758
* [FEATURE] Limits: Added the `-validation.separate-metrics-group-label` flag. This allows further separation of the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric by an additional `group` label - which is configured by this flag to be the value of a specific label on an incoming timeseries. Active groups are tracked and inactive groups are cleaned up on a defined interval. The maximum number of groups tracked is controlled by the `-max-separate-metrics-groups-per-user` flag. #3439
* [FEATURE] Overrides-exporter: Added experimental ring support to overrides-exporter via `-overrides-exporter.ring.enabled`. When enabled, the ring is used to establish a leader replica for the export of limit override metrics. #3908 #3953
* [FEATURE] Ephemeral storage (experimental): Mimir can now accept samples into "ephemeral storage". Such samples are available for querying for a short amount of time (`-blocks-storage.ephemeral-tsdb.retention-period`, defaults to 10 minutes), and then removed from memory. To use ephemeral storage, distributor must be configured with `-distributor.ephemeral-series-enabled` option. Series matching `-distributor.ephemeral-series-matchers` will be marked for storing into ephemeral storage in ingesters. Each tenant needs to have ephemeral storage enabled by using `-ingester.max-ephemeral-series-per-user` limit, which defaults to 0 (no ephemeral storage). Ingesters have new `-ingester.instance-limits.max-ephemeral-series` limit for total number of series in ephemeral storage across all tenants. If ingestion of samples into ephemeral storage fails, `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric will use values prefixed with `ephemeral-` for `reason` label. Querying of ephemeral storage is possible by using `{__mimir_storage__="ephemeral"}` as metric selector. Following new metrics related to ephemeral storage are introduced: #3897 #3922 #3961 #3997 #4004
  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series`
  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_created_total`
  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_removed_total`
  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_total`
  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_failures_total`
  * `cortex_ingester_memory_ephemeral_users`
  * `cortex_ingester_queries_ephemeral_total`
  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_samples`
  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_series`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added new metric `thanos_shipper_last_successful_upload_time`: Unix timestamp (in seconds) of the last successful TSDB block uploaded to the bucket. #3627
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Added `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-enabled` configuration for alertmanager client. #3432 #3597
* [ENHANCEMENT] Activity tracker logs now have `component=activity-tracker` label. #3556
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: remove labels with empty values #2439
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: track query HTTP requests in the Activity Tracker. #3561
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add experimental alternate implementation of index-header reader that does not use memory mapped files. The index-header reader is expected to improve stability of the store-gateway. You can enable this implementation with the flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-enabled`. #3639 #3691 #3703 #3742 #3785 #3787 #3797
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: add `cortex_query_scheduler_cancelled_requests_total` metric to track the number of requests that are already cancelled when dequeued. #3696
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_extended_ranges_total` metric to keep track of the ranges that the partitioner decided to overextend and merge in order to save API call to the object storage. #3769
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Auto-forget unhealthy compactors after ten failed ring heartbeats. #3771
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: change default value of `-ruler.for-grace-period` from `10m` to `2m` and update help text. The new default value reflects how we operate Mimir at Grafana Labs. #3817
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Added experimental flags to force usage of _postings for matchers cache_. These flags will be removed in the future and it's not recommended to change them. #3823
  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-ttl`
  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-size`
  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-force`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Improved series selection performance when some of the matchers do not match any series. #3827
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add new additional template function `tenantID` returning id of the tenant owning the alert. #3758
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add additional template function `grafanaExploreURL` returning URL to grafana explore with range query. #3849
* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce overhead of debug logging when filtered out. #3875
* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.16.2` to `alpine:3.17.1`. #3898
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Add new `/ingester/tsdb_metrics` endpoint to return tenant-specific TSDB metrics. #3923
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: CLI flag `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length` and its associated YAML configuration is now stable. #3882
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: rule groups now support optional and experimental `align_evaluation_time_on_interval` field, which causes all evaluations to happen on interval-aligned timestamp. #4013
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: ring-based service discovery is now stable. #4028
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: improved performance of prefix matching on the labels. #4055 #4080
* [BUGFIX] Log the names of services that are not yet running rather than `unsupported value type` when calling `/ready` and some services are not running. #3625
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix template spurious deletion with relative data dir. #3604
* [BUGFIX] Security: update prometheus/exporter-toolkit for CVE-2022-46146. #3675

* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: fix `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_bytes_total` metric to not double count overlapping ranges. #3769
* [BUGFIX] Update `github.com/thanos-io/objstore` to address issue with Multipart PUT on s3-compatible Object Storage. #3802 #3821
* [BUGFIX] Distributor, Query-scheduler: Make sure ring metrics include a `cortex_` prefix as expected by dashboards. #3809
* [BUGFIX] Querier: canceled requests are no longer reported as "consistency check" failures. #3837 #3927
* [BUGFIX] Distributor: don't panic when `metric_relabel_configs` in overrides contains null element. #3868
* [BUGFIX] Distributor: don't panic when OTLP histograms don't have any buckets. #3853
* [BUGFIX] Ingester, Compactor: fix panic that can occur when compaction fails. #3955
* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: return `Canceled` rather than `Aborted` error when the calling querier cancels the request. #4007

### Mixin

* [CHANGE] Alerts: Change `MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck` `for` time to 7 minutes to account for the time it takes for HPA to scale up. #3223
* [CHANGE] Dashboards: Removed the `Querier > Stages` panel from the `Mimir / Queries` dashboard. #3311
* [CHANGE] Configuration: The format of the `autoscaling` section of the configuration has changed to support more components. #3378
  * Instead of specific config variables for each component, they are listed in a dictionary. For example, `autoscaling.querier_enabled` becomes `autoscaling.querier.enabled`.
* [FEATURE] Dashboards: Added "Mimir / Overview resources" dashboard, providing an high level view over a Mimir cluster resources utilization. #3481

* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Remove "Inflight requests" from object store panels because the panel is not tracking the inflight requests to object storage. #3521

### Jsonnet

* [CHANGE] Replaced the deprecated `policy/v1beta1` with `policy/v1` when configuring a PodDisruptionBudget. #3284
* [CHANGE] [Common storage configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.3.x/operators-guide/configure/configure-object-storage-backend/#common-configuration) is now used to configure object storage in all components. This is a breaking change in terms of Jsonnet manifests and also a CLI flag update for components that use object storage, so it will require a rollout of those components. The changes include: #3257
  * `blocks_storage_backend` was renamed to `storage_backend` and is now used as the common storage backend for all components.
    * So were the related `blocks_storage_azure_account_(name|key)` and `blocks_storage_s3_endpoint` configurations.
  * `storage_s3_endpoint` is now rendered by default using the `aws_region` configuration instead of a hardcoded `us-east-1`.
  * `ruler_client_type` and `alertmanager_client_type` were renamed to `ruler_storage_backend` and `alertmanager_storage_backend` respectively, and their corresponding CLI flags won't be rendered unless explicitly set to a value different from the one in `storage_backend` (like `local`).
  * `alertmanager_s3_bucket_name`, `alertmanager_gcs_bucket_name` and `alertmanager_azure_container_name` have been removed, and replaced by a single `alertmanager_storage_bucket_name` configuration used for all object storages.
  * `genericBlocksStorageConfig` configuration object was removed, and so any extensions to it will be now ignored. Use `blockStorageConfig` instead.
  * `rulerClientConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageClientConfig` configuration objects were renamed to `rulerStorageConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageConfig` respectively, and so any extensions to their previous names will be now ignored. Use the new names instead.
  * The CLI flags `*.s3.region` are no longer rendered as they are optional and the region can be inferred by Mimir by performing an initial API call to the endpoint.
  * The migration to this change should usually consist of:
    * Renaming `blocks_storage_backend` key to `storage_backend`.
    * For Azure/S3:
      * Renaming `blocks_storage_(azure|s3)_*` configurations to `storage_(azure|s3)_*`.
      * If `ruler_storage_(azure|s3)_*` and `alertmanager_storage_(azure|s3)_*` keys were different from the `block_storage_*` ones, they should be now provided using CLI flags, see [configuration reference](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.3.x/operators-guide/configure/reference-configuration-parameters/) for more details.
    * Removing `ruler_client_type` and `alertmanager_client_type` if their value match the `storage_backend`, or renaming them to their new names otherwise.
    * Reviewing any possible extensions to `genericBlocksStorageConfig`, `rulerClientConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageClientConfig` and moving them to the corresponding new options.
    * Renaming the alertmanager's bucket name configuration from provider-specific to the new `alertmanager_storage_bucket_name` key.
* [CHANGE] The `overrides-exporter.libsonnet` file is now always imported. The overrides-exporter can be enabled in jsonnet setting the following: #3379
  ```jsonnet
  {
    _config+:: {
      overrides_exporter_enabled: true,
    }
  }
  ```
* [FEATURE] Added support for experimental read-write deployment mode. Enabling the read-write deployment mode on a existing Mimir cluster is a destructive operation, because the cluster will be re-created. If you're creating a new Mimir cluster, you can deploy it in read-write mode adding the following configuration: #3379 #3475 #3405
  ```jsonnet
  {
    _config+:: {
      deployment_mode: 'read-write',

      // See operations/mimir/read-write-deployment.libsonnet for more configuration options.
      mimir_write_replicas: 3,
      mimir_read_replicas: 2,
      mimir_backend_replicas: 3,
    }
  }
  ```
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add autoscaling support to the `mimir-read` component when running the read-write-deployment model. #3419
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `$._config.usageStatsConfig` to track the installation mode via the anonymous usage statistics. #3294
* [ENHANCEMENT] The query-tee node port (`$._config.query_tee_node_port`) is now optional. #3272
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for autoscaling distributors. #3378
* [ENHANCEMENT] Make auto-scaling logic ensure integer KEDA thresholds. #3512
* [BUGFIX] Fixed query-scheduler ring configuration for dedicated ruler's queries and query-frontends. #3237 #3239
* [BUGFIX] Jsonnet: Fix auto-scaling so that ruler-querier CPU threshold is a string-encoded integer millicores value. #3520

### Mimirtool

* [FEATURE] Added `mimirtool alertmanager verify` command to validate configuration without uploading. #3440
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `mimirtool rules delete-namespace` command to delete all of the rule groups in a namespace including the namespace itself. #3136
* [ENHANCEMENT] Refactor `mimirtool analyze prometheus`: add concurrency and resiliency #3349
  * Add `--concurrency` flag. Default: number of logical CPUs
* [BUGFIX] `--log.level=debug` now correctly prints the response from the remote endpoint when a request fails. #3180

* [BUGFIX] Fix small typos in API reference. #3526
* [BUGFIX] Fixed TSDB retention mentioned in the "Recover source blocks from ingesters" runbook. #3278
* [BUGFIX] Fixed configuration example in the "Configuring the Grafana Mimir query-frontend to work with Prometheus" guide. #3374

### Tools

* [FEATURE] Add `copyblocks` tool, to copy Mimir blocks between two GCS buckets. #3264
* [ENHANCEMENT] copyblocks: copy no-compact global markers and optimize min time filter check. #3268
* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimir rules GitHub action: Added the ability to change default value of `label` when running `prepare` command. #3236
* [BUGFIX] Mimir rules Github action: Fix single line output. #3421

## 2.4.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Distributor: change the default value of `-distributor.remote-timeout` to `2s` from `20s` and `-distributor.forwarding.request-timeout` to `2s` from `10s` to improve distributor resource usage when ingesters crash. #2728 #2912
* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: added the `-ingester.ring.store` value. #2981
* [CHANGE] Series metadata `HELP` that is longer than `-validation.max-metadata-length` is now truncated silently, instead of being dropped with a 400 status code. #2993
* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default setting for `-ingester.ring.readiness-check-ring-health` from `true` to `false`. #2953
* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking has been enabled by default, to help Mimir maintainers make better decisions to support the open source community. #2939 #3034
* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: added the minimum and maximum value of `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window`. #2940
* [CHANGE] The default hash ring heartbeat period for distributors, ingesters, rulers and compactors has been increased from `5s` to `15s`. Now the default heartbeat period for all Mimir hash rings is `15s`. #3033
* [CHANGE] Reduce the default TSDB head compaction concurrency (`-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-concurrency`) from 5 to 1, in order to reduce CPU spikes. #3093
* [CHANGE] Ruler: the ruler's [remote evaluation mode](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/operators-guide/architecture/components/ruler/#remote) (`-ruler.query-frontend.address`) is now stable. #3109
* [CHANGE] Limits: removed the deprecated YAML configuration option `active_series_custom_trackers_config`. Please use `active_series_custom_trackers` instead. #3110
* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed the deprecated configuration option `-ingester.ring.join-after`. #3111
* [CHANGE] Querier: removed the deprecated configuration option `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`. The value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` is now used internally for shuffle sharding lookback, while you can use `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to enable or disable shuffle sharding on the read path. #3111
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: cluster label verification feature (`-memberlist.cluster-label` and `-memberlist.cluster-label-verification-disabled`) is now marked as stable. #3108
* [CHANGE] Distributor: only single per-tenant forwarding endpoint can be configured now. Support for per-rule endpoint has been removed. #3095
* [FEATURE] Query-scheduler: added an experimental ring-based service discovery support for the query-scheduler. Refer to [query-scheduler configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/next/operators-guide/architecture/components/query-scheduler/#configuration) for more information. #2957
* [FEATURE] Introduced the experimental endpoint `/api/v1/user_limits` exposed by all components that load runtime configuration. This endpoint exposes realtime limits for the authenticated tenant, in JSON format. #2864 #3017
* [FEATURE] Query-scheduler: added the experimental configuration option `-query-scheduler.max-used-instances` to restrict the number of query-schedulers effectively used regardless how many replicas are running. This feature can be useful when using the experimental read-write deployment mode. #3005
* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to go 1.19.2. #2637 #3127 #3129
* [ENHANCEMENT] Runtime config: don't unmarshal runtime configuration files if they haven't changed. This can save a bit of CPU and memory on every component using runtime config. #2954
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_skipped_total` and `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_attempted_total` metrics to track the reason why query results are not cached. #2855
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: pool more connections per host when forwarding request. Mark requests as idempotent so they can be retried under some conditions. #2968
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: failure to send request to forwarding target now also increments `cortex_distributor_forward_errors_total`, with `status_code="failed"`. #2968
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added support forwarding push requests via gRPC, using `httpgrpc` messages from weaveworks/common library. #2996
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend / Querier: increase internal backoff period used to retry connections to query-frontend / query-scheduler. #3011
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: do not log "error processing requests from scheduler" when the query-scheduler is shutting down. #3012
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: query sharding process is now time-bounded and it is cancelled if the request is aborted. #3028
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: improved Prometheus response JSON encoding performance. #2450
* [ENHANCEMENT] TLS: added configuration parameters to configure the client's TLS cipher suites and minimum version. The following new CLI flags have been added: #3070
  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-min-version`
  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`

  * `-ingester.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`
  * `-memberlist.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-memberlist.tls-min-version`
  * `-querier.frontend-client.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-querier.frontend-client.tls-min-version`
  * `-querier.store-gateway-client.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-querier.store-gateway-client.tls-min-version`
  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-min-version`
  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.tls-min-version`
  * `-query-scheduler.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-query-scheduler.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`
  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-min-version`
  * `-ruler.client.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-ruler.client.tls-min-version`

  * `-ruler.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`
  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`
  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-min-version`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent-reject-over-limit` option to allow requests that exceed the max number of inflight object storage requests to be rejected. #2999
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: allow setting a separate limit on the total (before splitting/sharding) query length of range queries with the new experimental `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length` flag, which defaults to `-store.max-query-length` if unset or set to 0. #3058
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Lower TTL for cache entries overlapping the out-of-order samples ingestion window (re-using `-ingester.out-of-order-allowance` from ingesters). #2935
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added support to forcefully disable recording and/or alerting rules evaluation. The following new configuration options have been introduced, which can be overridden on a per-tenant basis in the runtime configuration: #3088
  * `-ruler.recording-rules-evaluation-enabled`
  * `-ruler.alerting-rules-evaluation-enabled`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Improved error messages reported when the distributor fails to remote write to ingesters. #3055

* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: reduced memory utilization in Mimir clusters with a large number of tenants. #3143
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added extra span logging to improve observability. #3131
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: cleaning up different tenants' old blocks and updating bucket indexes is now more independent. This prevents a single tenant from delaying cleanup for other tenants. #2631
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: request rate, ingestion rate, and inflight requests limits are now enforced before reading and parsing the body of the request. This makes the distributor more resilient against a burst of requests over those limit. #2419
* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix 400 response while handling streaming remote read. #2963
* [BUGFIX] Fix a bug causing query-frontend, query-scheduler, and querier not failing if one of their internal components fail. #2978
* [BUGFIX] Querier: re-balance the querier worker connections when a query-frontend or query-scheduler is terminated. #3005
* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Now returns the quorum error from ingesters. For example, with replication_factor=3, two HTTP 400 errors and one HTTP 500 error, now the distributor will always return HTTP 400. Previously the behaviour was to return the error which the distributor first received. #2979
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix panic when ruler.external_url is explicitly set to an empty string ("") in YAML. #2915
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix support for the Telegram API URL in the global settings. #3097
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix parsing of label matchers without label value in the API used to retrieve alerts. #3097
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Fix not restoring alert state for rule groups when other ruler replicas shut down. #3156

* [BUGFIX] Fix distributor from returning a `500` status code when a `400` was received from the ingester. #3211
* [BUGFIX] Fix incorrect OS value set in Mimir v2.3.* RPM packages. #3221

### Mixin

* [CHANGE] Alerts: MimirQuerierAutoscalerNotActive is now critical and fires after 1h instead of 15m. #2958

* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: `gossip_member_label` is now set for ruler-queriers. #3141

### Mimirtool

* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool analyze: Store the query errors instead of exit during the analysis. #3052
* [BUGFIX] mimir-tool remote-read: fix returns where some conditions [return nil error even if there is error](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/issues/260). #3053

* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Stop panics on OTLP endpoint when a single metric has multiple timeseries. #3040

## 2.3.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Ingester: Added user label to ingester metric `cortex_ingester_tsdb_out_of_order_samples_appended_total`. On multitenant clusters this helps us find the rate of appended out-of-order samples for a specific tenant. #2493
* [CHANGE] Compactor: delete source and output blocks from local disk on compaction failed, to reduce likelihood that subsequent compactions fail because of no space left on disk. #2261
* [CHANGE] Ruler: Remove unused CLI flags `-ruler.search-pending-for` and `-ruler.flush-period` (and their respective YAML config options). #2288
* [CHANGE] Successful gRPC requests are no longer logged (only affects internal API calls). #2309
* [CHANGE] Add new `-*.consul.cas-retry-delay` flags. They have a default value of `1s`, while previously there was no delay between retries. #2309
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Remove the experimental ability to run requests in a dedicated OS thread pool and associated CLI flag `-store-gateway.thread-pool-size`. #2423
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: disabled TCP-based ping fallback, because Mimir already uses a custom transport based on TCP. #2456
* [CHANGE] Change default value for `-distributor.ha-tracker.max-clusters` to `100` to provide a DoS protection. #2465
* [CHANGE] Experimental block upload API exposed by compactor has changed: Previous `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}` endpoint for starting block upload is now `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/start`, and previous endpoint `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}?uploadComplete=true` for finishing block upload is now `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/finish`. New API endpoint has been added: `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/check`. #2486 #2548
* [CHANGE] Compactor: changed `-compactor.max-compaction-time` default from `0s` (disabled) to `1h`. When compacting blocks for a tenant, the compactor will move to compact blocks of another tenant or re-plan blocks to compact at least every 1h. #2514
* [CHANGE] Distributor: removed previously deprecated `extend_writes` (see #1856) YAML key and `-distributor.extend-writes` CLI flag from the distributor config. #2551
* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed previously deprecated `active_series_custom_trackers` (see #1188) YAML key from the ingester config. #2552
* [CHANGE] The tenant ID `__mimir_cluster` is reserved by Mimir and not allowed to store metrics. #2643
* [CHANGE] Purger: removed the purger component and moved its API endpoints `/purger/delete_tenant` and `/purger/delete_tenant_status` to the compactor at `/compactor/delete_tenant` and `/compactor/delete_tenant_status`. The new endpoints on the compactor are stable. #2644
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Change the leave timeout duration (`-memberlist.leave-timeout duration`) from 5s to 20s and connection timeout (`-memberlist.packet-dial-timeout`) from 5s to 2s. This makes leave timeout 10x the connection timeout, so that we can communicate the leave to at least 1 node, if the first 9 we try to contact times out. #2669
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: return status code `412 Precondition Failed` and log info message when alertmanager isn't configured for a tenant. #2635
* [CHANGE] Distributor: if forwarding rules are used to forward samples, exemplars are now removed from the request. #2710 #2725
* [CHANGE] Limits: change the default value of `max_global_series_per_metric` limit to `0` (disabled). Setting this limit by default does not provide much benefit because series are sharded by all labels. #2714
* [CHANGE] Ingester: experimental `-blocks-storage.tsdb.new-chunk-disk-mapper` has been removed, new chunk disk mapper is now always used, and is no longer marked experimental. Default value of `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-chunks-write-queue-size` has changed to 1000000, this enables async chunk queue by default, which leads to improved latency on the write path when new chunks are created in ingesters. #2762
* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed deprecated `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` option. TSDB-level isolation is now always disabled in Mimir. #2782
* [CHANGE] Compactor: `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` must either be set to 0 (to disable partial blocks deletion) or a value higher than `4h`. #2787
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: CLI flag `-query-frontend.align-querier-with-step` has been deprecated. Please use `-query-frontend.align-queries-with-step` instead. #2840
* [FEATURE] Compactor: Adds the ability to delete partial blocks after a configurable delay. This option can be configured per tenant. #2285
  - `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay`, as a duration string, allows you to set the delay since a partial block has been modified before marking it for deletion. A value of `0`, the default, disables this feature.
  - The metric `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total` has a new value for the `reason` label `reason="partial"`, when a block deletion marker is triggered by the partial block deletion delay.
* [FEATURE] Querier: enabled support for queries with negative offsets, which are not cached in the query results cache. #2429
* [FEATURE] EXPERIMENTAL: OpenTelemetry Metrics ingestion path on `/otlp/v1/metrics`. #695 #2436 #2461
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added support for tenant federation to metric metadata endpoint. #2467
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: introduced experimental support to split instant queries by time. The instant query splitting can be enabled setting `-query-frontend.split-instant-queries-by-interval`. #2469 #2564 #2565 #2570 #2571 #2572 #2573 #2574 #2575 #2576 #2581 #2582 #2601 #2632 #2633 #2634 #2641 #2642 #2766
* [FEATURE] Introduced an experimental anonymous usage statistics tracking (disabled by default), to help Mimir maintainers make better decisions to support the open source community. The tracking system anonymously collects non-sensitive, non-personally identifiable information about the running Mimir cluster, and is disabled by default. #2643 #2662 #2685 #2732 #2733 #2735
* [FEATURE] Introduced an experimental deployment mode called read-write and running a fully featured Mimir cluster with three components: write, read and backend. The read-write deployment mode is a trade-off between the monolithic mode (only one component, no isolation) and the microservices mode (many components, high isolation). #2754 #2838
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Decreased distributor tests execution time. #2562
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Allow the HTTP `proxy_url` configuration option in the receiver's configuration. #2317
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: optimize shuffle-shard computation when lookback is used, and all instances have registered timestamp within the lookback window. In that case we can immediately return origial ring, because we would select all instances anyway. #2309
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: added experimental memberlist cluster label support via `-memberlist.cluster-label` and `-memberlist.cluster-label-verification-disabled` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). #2354
* [ENHANCEMENT] Object storage can now be configured for all components using the `common` YAML config option key (or `-common.storage.*` CLI flags). #2330 #2347
* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to go 1.18.4. #2400
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway, listblocks: list of blocks now includes stats from `meta.json` file: number of series, samples and chunks. #2425
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added more buckets to `cortex_ingester_client_request_duration_seconds` histogram metric, to correctly track requests taking longer than 1s (up until 16s). #2445
* [ENHANCEMENT] Azure client: Improve memory usage for large object storage downloads. #2408
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `-distributor.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests-bytes`. This limit protects the distributor against multiple large requests that together may cause an OOM, but are only a few, so do not trigger the `max-inflight-push-requests` limit. #2413
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Drop exemplars in distributor for tenants where exemplars are disabled. #2504
* [ENHANCEMENT] Runtime Config: Allow operator to specify multiple comma-separated yaml files in `-runtime-config.file` that will be merged in left to right order. #2583
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query sharding: shard binary operations only if it doesn't lead to non-shardable vector selectors in one of the operands. #2696
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add packaging for both debian based deb file and redhat based rpm file using FPM. #1803
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `cortex_distributor_query_ingester_chunks_deduped_total` and `cortex_distributor_query_ingester_chunks_total` metrics for determining how effective ingester chunk deduplication at query time is. #2713
* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Docker base images to `alpine:3.16.2`. #2729
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo` endpoint. #2724
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Ensure all queries pulled from query-frontend or query-scheduler are immediately executed. The maximum workers concurrency in each querier is configured by `-querier.max-concurrent`. #2598
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `cortex_distributor_received_requests_total` and `cortex_distributor_requests_in_total` metrics to provide visiblity into appropriate per-tenant request limits. #2770
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add single forwarding remote-write endpoint for a tenant (`forwarding_endpoint`), instead of using per-rule endpoints. This takes precendence over per-rule endpoints. #2801
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `err-mimir-distributor-max-write-message-size` to the errors catalog. #2470
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add sanity check at startup to ensure the configured filesystem directories don't overlap for different components. #2828 #2947
* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fixed a bug on the experimental out-of-order implementation that led to wrong query results. #2701
* [BUGFIX] Compactor: log the actual error on compaction failed. #2261
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: restore state from storage even when running a single replica. #2293
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: do not block "List Prometheus rules" API endpoint while syncing rules. #2289
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: return proper `*status.Status` error when running in remote operational mode. #2417
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: ensure the configured `-alertmanager.web.external-url` is either a path starting with `/`, or a full URL including the scheme and hostname. #2381 #2542
* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fix problem with loss of some packets, typically ring updates when instances were removed from the ring during shutdown. #2418
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix misfiring `MimirIngesterHasUnshippedBlocks` and stale `cortex_ingester_oldest_unshipped_block_timestamp_seconds` when some block uploads fail. #2435
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 429 to 500 when request queue is full. #2447
* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: Fix problem with ring being empty right after startup. Memberlist KV store now tries to "fast-join" the cluster to avoid serving empty KV store. #2505
* [BUGFIX] Compactor: Fix bug when using `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay`: compactor didn't correctly check for modification time of all block files. #2559
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix wrong query sharding results for queries with boolean result like `1 < bool 0`. #2558
* [BUGFIX] Fixed error messages related to per-instance limits incorrectly reporting they can be set on a per-tenant basis. #2610
* [BUGFIX] Perform HA-deduplication before forwarding samples according to forwarding rules in the distributor. #2603 #2709
* [BUGFIX] Fix reporting of tracing spans from PromQL engine. #2707
* [BUGFIX] Apply relabel and drop_label rules before forwarding rules in the distributor. #2703
* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Register `cortex_discarded_requests_total` metric, which previously was not registered and therefore not exported. #2712
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix not restoring alerts' state at startup. #2648
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix disk filling up after restarting ingesters with out-of-order support disabled while it was enabled before. #2799
* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: retry joining memberlist cluster on startup when no nodes are resolved. #2837
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 413 to 500 when request is too large. #2819
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: revert upstream alertmananger to v0.24.0 to fix panic when unmarshalling email headers #2924 #2925

### Mixin

* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: add missing API routes to Ruler dashboard. #2412
* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: stop setting 'interval' in dashboards; it should be set on your datasource. #2802

### Jsonnet

* [CHANGE] query-scheduler is enabled by default. We advise to deploy the query-scheduler to improve the scalability of the query-frontend. #2431
* [CHANGE] Replaced anti-affinity rules with pod topology spread constraints for distributor, query-frontend, querier and ruler. #2517
  - The following configuration options have been removed:
    - `distributor_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`
    - `query_frontend_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`
    - `querier_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`
    - `ruler_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`
  - The following configuration options have been added:
    - `distributor_topology_spread_max_skew`
    - `query_frontend_topology_spread_max_skew`
    - `querier_topology_spread_max_skew`
    - `ruler_topology_spread_max_skew`
* [CHANGE] Change `max_global_series_per_metric` to 0 in all plans, and as a default value. #2669
* [FEATURE] Memberlist: added support for experimental memberlist cluster label, through the jsonnet configuration options `memberlist_cluster_label` and `memberlist_cluster_label_verification_disabled`. #2349
* [FEATURE] Added ruler-querier autoscaling support. It requires [KEDA](https://keda.sh) installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Ruler-querier autoscaler can be enabled and configure through the following options in the jsonnet config: #2545
  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_enabled`: `true` to enable autoscaling.
  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_min_replicas`: minimum number of ruler-querier replicas.
  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_max_replicas`: maximum number of ruler-querier replicas.
  * `autoscaling_prometheus_url`: Prometheus base URL from which to scrape Mimir metrics (e.g. `http://prometheus.default:9090/prometheus`).
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist now uses DNS service-discovery by default. #2549
* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade memcached image tag to `memcached:1.6.16-alpine`. #2740
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `$._config.configmaps` and `$._config.runtime_config_files` to make it easy to add new configmaps or runtime config file to all components. #2748

### Mimirtool

* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `mimirtool backfill` command to upload Prometheus blocks using API available in the compactor. #1822
* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool bucket-validation: Verify existing objects can be overwritten by subsequent uploads. #2491
* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool config convert: Now supports migrating to the current version of Mimir. #2629
* [BUGFIX] mimirtool analyze: Fix dashboard JSON unmarshalling errors by using custom parsing. #2386
* [BUGFIX] Version checking no longer prompts for updating when already on latest version. #2723

### Mimir Continuous Test

* [ENHANCEMENT] Added basic authentication and bearer token support for when Mimir is behind a gateway authenticating the calls. #2717

### Query-tee

* [CHANGE] Renamed CLI flag `-server.service-port` to `-server.http-service-port`. #2683
* [CHANGE] Renamed metric `cortex_querytee_request_duration_seconds` to `cortex_querytee_backend_request_duration_seconds`. Metric `cortex_querytee_request_duration_seconds` is now reported without label `backend`. #2683
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added HTTP over gRPC support to `query-tee` to allow testing gRPC requests to Mimir instances. #2683

### Documentation

* [ENHANCEMENT] Referenced `mimirtool` commands in the HTTP API documentation. #2516
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved DNS service discovery documentation. #2513

### Tools

* [ENHANCEMENT] `markblocks` now processes multiple blocks concurrently. #2677

## 2.2.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Increased default configuration for `-server.grpc-max-recv-msg-size-bytes` and `-server.grpc-max-send-msg-size-bytes` from 4MB to 100MB. #1884
* [CHANGE] Default values have changed for the following settings. This improves query performance for recent data (within 12h) by only reading from ingesters: #1909 #1921
    - `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` now defaults to `10h` (previously `0`)
    - `-querier.query-store-after` now defaults to `12h` (previously `0`)
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed support for migrating local files from Cortex 1.8 or earlier. Related to original Cortex PR https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/3910. #2253
* [CHANGE] The following settings are now classified as advanced because the defaults should work for most users and tuning them requires in-depth knowledge of how the read path works: #1929
    - `-querier.query-ingesters-within`
    - `-querier.query-store-after`
* [CHANGE] Config flag category overrides can be set dynamically at runtime. #1934
* [CHANGE] Ingester: deprecated `-ingester.ring.join-after`. Mimir now behaves as this setting is always set to 0s. This configuration option will be removed in Mimir 2.4.0. #1965
* [CHANGE] Blocks uploaded by ingester no longer contain `__org_id__` label. Compactor now ignores this label and will compact blocks with and without this label together. `mimirconvert` tool will remove the label from blocks as "unknown" label. #1972
* [CHANGE] Querier: deprecated `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`, instead adding `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to enable or disable shuffle sharding on the read path. The value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` is now used internally for shuffle sharding lookback. #2110
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` now defaults to false. Previously it defaulted to true. #2168
* [CHANGE] Ruler: `/api/v1/rules*` and `/prometheus/rules*` configuration endpoints are removed. Use `/prometheus/config/v1/rules*`. #2182
* [CHANGE] Ingester: `-ingester.exemplars-update-period` has been renamed to `-ingester.tsdb-config-update-period`. You can use it to update multiple, per-tenant TSDB configurations. #2187
* [FEATURE] Ingester: (Experimental) Add the ability to ingest out-of-order samples up to an allowed limit. If you enable this feature, it requires additional memory and disk space. This feature also enables a write-behind log, which might lead to longer ingester-start replays. When this feature is disabled, there is no overhead on memory, disk space, or startup times. #2187
  * `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window`, as duration string, allows you to set how back in time a sample can be. The default is `0s`, where `s` is seconds.
  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_out_of_order_samples_appended_total` metric tracks the total number of out-of-order samples ingested by the ingester.
  * `cortex_discarded_samples_total` has a new label `reason="sample-too-old"`, when the `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window` flag is greater than zero. The label tracks the number of samples that were discarded for being too old; they were out of order, but beyond the time window allowed. The labels `reason="sample-out-of-order"` and `reason="sample-out-of-bounds"` are not used when out-of-order ingestion is enabled.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added limit to prevent tenants from sending excessive number of requests: #1843
  * The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been added:
    * `-distributor.request-rate-limit`
    * `-distributor.request-burst-limit`
  * The following metric is exposed to tell how many requests have been rejected:
    * `cortex_discarded_requests_total`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add the experimental ability to run requests in a dedicated OS thread pool. This feature can be configured using `-store-gateway.thread-pool-size` and is disabled by default. Replaces the ability to run index header operations in a dedicated thread pool. #1660 #1812
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved error messages to make them easier to understand; each now have a unique, global identifier that you can use to look up in the runbooks for more information. #1907 #1919 #1888 #1939 #1984 #2009 #2056 #2066 #2104 #2150 #2234
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist KV: incoming messages are now processed on per-key goroutine. This may reduce loss of "maintanance" packets in busy memberlist installations, but use more CPU. New `memberlist_client_received_broadcasts_dropped_total` counter tracks number of dropped per-key messages. #1912
* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks Storage, Alertmanager, Ruler: add support a prefix to the bucket store (`*_storage.storage_prefix`). This enables using the same bucket for the three components. #1686 #1951
* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Docker base images to `alpine:3.16.0`. #2028
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add experimental configuration option for the store-gateway to attempt to pre-populate the file system cache when memory-mapping index-header files. Enabled with `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled=true`. Note this flag only has an effect when running on Linux. #2019 #2054
* [ENHANCEMENT] Chunk Mapper: reduce memory usage of async chunk mapper. #2043
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce sleep time when reading WAL. #2098
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Run sanity check on blocks storage configuration at startup. #2144
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Add HTTP API for uploading TSDB blocks. Enabled with `-compactor.block-upload-enabled`. #1694 #2126
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Enable querying overlapping blocks by default. #2187
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Auto-forget unhealthy distributors after ten failed ring heartbeats. #2154
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add new metric `cortex_distributor_forward_errors_total` for error codes resulting from forwarding requests. #2077
* [ENHANCEMENT] `/ready` endpoint now returns and logs detailed services information. #2055
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached client: Reduce number of connections required to fetch cached keys from memcached. #1920
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved error message returned when `-querier.query-store-after` validation fails. #1914
* [BUGFIX] Fix regexp parsing panic for regexp label matchers with start/end quantifiers. #1883
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed deceiving error log "failed to update cached shipped blocks after shipper initialisation", occurring for each new tenant in the ingester. #1893
* [BUGFIX] Ring: fix bug where instances may appear unhealthy in the hash ring web UI even though they are not. #1933
* [BUGFIX] API: gzip is now enforced when identity encoding is explicitly rejected. #1864
* [BUGFIX] Fix panic at startup when Mimir is running in monolithic mode and query sharding is enabled. #2036
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: report `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total` metric for any remote query error except 4xx when remote operational mode is enabled. #2053 #2143
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix slow rollout when using `-ingester.ring.unregister-on-shutdown=false` with long `-ingester.ring.heartbeat-period`. #2085
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: add timeout for remote rule evaluation queries to prevent rule group evaluations getting stuck indefinitely. The duration is configurable with `-querier.timeout` (default `2m`). #2090 #2222
* [BUGFIX] Limits: Active series custom tracker configuration has been named back from `active_series_custom_trackers_config` to `active_series_custom_trackers`. For backwards compatibility both version is going to be supported for until Mimir v2.4. When both fields are specified, `active_series_custom_trackers_config` takes precedence over `active_series_custom_trackers`. #2101
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed the order of labels applied when incrementing the `cortex_discarded_metadata_total` metric. #2096
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed bug where retrieving metadata for a metric with multiple metadata entries would return multiple copies of a single metadata entry rather than all available entries. #2096
* [BUGFIX] Distributor: canceled requests are no longer accounted as internal errors. #2157
* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: Fix typo in memberlist admin UI. #2202
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed typo in error message when ruler failed to decode a rule group. #2151
* [BUGFIX] Active series custom tracker configuration is now displayed properly on `/runtime_config` page. #2065
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: `vector` and `time` functions were sharded, which made expressions like `vector(1) > 0 and vector(1)` fail. #2355

### Mixin

* [CHANGE] Split `mimir_queries` rules group into `mimir_queries` and `mimir_ingester_queries` to keep number of rules per group within the default per-tenant limit. #1885
* [CHANGE] Dashboards: Expose full image tag in "Mimir / Rollout progress" dashboard's "Pod per version panel." #1932
* [CHANGE] Dashboards: Disabled gateway panels by default, because most users don't have a gateway exposing the metrics expected by Mimir dashboards. You can re-enable it setting `gateway_enabled: true` in the mixin config and recompiling the mixin running `make build-mixin`. #1955
* [CHANGE] Alerts: adapt `MimirFrontendQueriesStuck` and `MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck` to consider ruler query path components. #1949
* [CHANGE] Alerts: Change `MimirRulerTooManyFailedQueries` severity to `critical`. #2165
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add config option `datasource_regex` to customise the regular expression used to select valid datasources for Mimir dashboards. #1802
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Added "Mimir / Remote ruler reads" and "Mimir / Remote ruler reads resources" dashboards. #1911 #1937
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Make networking panels work for pods created by the mimir-distributed helm chart. #1927
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Add `MimirStoreGatewayNoSyncedTenants` alert that fires when there is a store-gateway owning no tenants. #1882
* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Make `recording_rules_range_interval` configurable for cases where Mimir metrics are scraped less often that every 30 seconds. #2118
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added minimum Grafana version to mixin dashboards. #1943
* [BUGFIX] Fix `container_memory_usage_bytes:sum` recording rule. #1865
* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alerts if Mimir alertmanager is activated. #1870
* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirRulerMissedEvaluations` to show % of missed alerts as a value between 0 and 100 instead of 0 and 1. #1895
* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` alert false positive when Mimir is deployed in monolithic mode. #1902
* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` to make it less sensitive during rollouts and fire one alert per installation, not per job. #1926
* [BUGFIX] Do not trigger `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` alerts if no container limits are supplied. #1905
* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Remove empty "Chunks per query" panel from `Mimir / Queries` dashboard. #1928
* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Use Grafana's `$__rate_interval` for rate queries in dashboards to support scrape intervals of >15s. #2011
* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Make each version of `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` distinct to avoid rule evaluation failures due to duplicate series being generated. #2197
* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alert when using remote ruler evaluation. #2159

### Jsonnet

* [CHANGE] Remove use of `-querier.query-store-after`, `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`, `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within`, and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.close-idle-tsdb-timeout` CLI flags since the values now match defaults. #1915 #1921
* [CHANGE] Change default value for `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.memcached.timeout` to `450ms` to increase use of cached data. #2035
* [CHANGE] The `memberlist_ring_enabled` configuration now applies to Alertmanager. #2102 #2103 #2107
* [CHANGE] Default value for `memberlist_ring_enabled` is now true. It means that all hash rings use Memberlist as default KV store instead of Consul (previous default). #2161
* [CHANGE] Configure `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-user` to correspond to 20% of the configured max number of series per tenant. #2250
* [CHANGE] Configure `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-metric` to be 10. #2250
* [CHANGE] Change `_config.multi_zone_ingester_max_unavailable` to 25. #2251
* [FEATURE] Added querier autoscaling support. It requires [KEDA](https://keda.sh) installed in the Kubernetes cluster and query-scheduler enabled in the Mimir cluster. Querier autoscaler can be enabled and configure through the following options in the jsonnet config: #2013 #2023
  * `autoscaling_querier_enabled`: `true` to enable autoscaling.
  * `autoscaling_querier_min_replicas`: minimum number of querier replicas.
  * `autoscaling_querier_max_replicas`: maximum number of querier replicas.
  * `autoscaling_prometheus_url`: Prometheus base URL from which to scrape Mimir metrics (e.g. `http://prometheus.default:9090/prometheus`).
* [FEATURE] Jsonnet: Add support for ruler remote evaluation mode (`ruler_remote_evaluation_enabled`), which deploys and uses a dedicated query path for rule evaluation. This enables the benefits of the query-frontend for rule evaluation, such as query sharding. #2073
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `compactor` service, that can be used to route requests directly to compactor (e.g. admin UI). #2063
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a `consul_enabled` configuration option to provide the ability to disable consul. It is automatically set to false when `memberlist_ring_enabled` is true and `multikv_migration_enabled` (used for migration from Consul to memberlist) is not set. #2093 #2152
* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix disabling shuffle sharding on the read path whilst keeping it enabled on write path. #2164

### Mimirtool

* [CHANGE] mimirtool rules: `--use-legacy-routes` now toggles between using `/prometheus/config/v1/rules` (default) and `/api/v1/rules` (legacy) endpoints. #2182
* [FEATURE] Added bearer token support for when Mimir is behind a gateway authenticating by bearer token. #2146
* [BUGFIX] mimirtool analyze: Fix dashboard JSON unmarshalling errors (#1840). #1973
* [BUGFIX] Make mimirtool build for Windows work again. #2273

### Mimir Continuous Test

* [ENHANCEMENT] Added the `-tests.smoke-test` flag to run the `mimir-continuous-test` suite once and immediately exit. #2047 #2094
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added the `-tests.write-protocol` flag to write using the `prometheus` remote write protocol or `otlp-http` in the `mimir-continuous-test` suite. #5719

## 2.1.0

### Grafana Mimir

* [CHANGE] Compactor: No longer upload debug meta files to object storage. #1257
* [CHANGE] Default values have changed for the following settings: #1547
    - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-recv-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was not configurable and set to 16 MiB)
    - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-send-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was not configurable and set to 4 MiB)
    - `-alertmanager.max-recv-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was 16 MiB)
* [CHANGE] Ingester: Add `user` label to metrics `cortex_ingester_ingested_samples_total` and `cortex_ingester_ingested_samples_failures_total`. #1533
* [CHANGE] Ingester: Changed `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` default from `true` to `false`. The config option has also been deprecated and will be removed in 2 minor version. #1655
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: results cache keys are now versioned, this will cause cache to be re-filled when rolling out this version. #1631
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: enabled attributes in-memory cache by default. New default configuration is `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.attributes-in-memory-max-items=50000`. #1727
* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed the metric `cortex_compactor_garbage_collected_blocks_total` since it duplicates `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total`. #1728
* [CHANGE] All: Logs that used the`org_id` label now use `user` label. #1634 #1758
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the following metrics are not exported for a given `user` and `integration` when the metric value is zero: #1783
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_failed_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_requests_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_requests_failed_total`
  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total`
* [CHANGE] Removed the following metrics exposed by the Mimir hash rings: #1791
  * `cortex_member_ring_tokens_owned`
  * `cortex_member_ring_tokens_to_own`
  * `cortex_ring_tokens_owned`
  * `cortex_ring_member_ownership_percent`
* [CHANGE] Querier / Ruler: removed the following metrics tracking number of query requests send to each ingester. You can use `cortex_request_duration_seconds_count{route=~"/cortex.Ingester/(QueryStream|QueryExemplars)"}` instead. #1797
  * `cortex_distributor_ingester_queries_total`
  * `cortex_distributor_ingester_query_failures_total`
* [CHANGE] Distributor: removed the following metrics tracking the number of requests from a distributor to ingesters: #1799
  * `cortex_distributor_ingester_appends_total`
  * `cortex_distributor_ingester_append_failures_total`
* [CHANGE] Distributor / Ruler: deprecated `-distributor.extend-writes`. Now Mimir always behaves as if this setting was set to `false`, which we expect to be safe for every Mimir cluster setup. #1856
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added support for [streaming remote read](https://prometheus.io/blog/2019/10/10/remote-read-meets-streaming/). Should be noted that benefits of chunking the response are partial here, since in a typical `query-frontend` setup responses will be buffered until they've been completed. #1735
* [FEATURE] Ruler: Allow setting `evaluation_delay` for each rule group via rules group configuration file. #1474
* [FEATURE] Ruler: Added support for expression remote evaluation. #1536 #1818

    * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-key-path`
    * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-server-name`
    * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-insecure-skip-verify`
* [FEATURE] Distributor: Added the ability to forward specifics metrics to alternative remote_write API endpoints. #1052
* [FEATURE] Ingester: Active series custom trackers now supports runtime tenant-specific overrides. The configuration has been moved to limit config, the ingester config has been deprecated.  #1188
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager API: Concurrency limit for GET requests is now configurable using `-alertmanager.max-concurrent-get-requests-per-tenant`. #1547
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added the ability to configure additional gRPC client settings for the Alertmanager distributor #1547
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.backoff-max-period`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.backoff-min-period`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.backoff-on-ratelimits`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.backoff-retries`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-client-rate-limit`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-client-rate-limit-burst`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-compression`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-recv-msg-size`
  - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-send-msg-size`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add more detailed query information to ruler query stats logging. #1411
* [ENHANCEMENT] Admin: Admin API now has some styling. #1482 #1549 #1821 #1824
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: added `insight=true` field to alertmanager dispatch logs. #1379
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add the experimental ability to run index header operations in a dedicated thread pool. This feature can be configured using `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-thread-pool-size` and is disabled by default. #1660
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: don't drop all blocks if instance finds itself as unhealthy or missing in the ring. #1806 #1823
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: wait until inflight queries are completed when shutting down queriers. #1756 #1767
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: do not shard queries with a subquery unless the subquery is inside a shardable aggregation function call. #1542
* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: added `component=query-frontend` label to results cache memcached metrics to fix a panic when Mimir is running in single binary mode and results cache is enabled. #1704
* [BUGFIX] Mimir: services' status content-type is now correctly set to `text/html`. #1575
* [BUGFIX] Multikv: Fix panic when using using runtime config to set primary KV store used by `multi` KV. #1587
* [BUGFIX] Multikv: Fix watching for runtime config changes in `multi` KV store in ruler and querier. #1665
* [BUGFIX] Memcached: allow to use CNAME DNS records for the memcached backend addresses. #1654
* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed temporary partial query results when shuffle sharding is enabled and hash ring backend storage is flushed / reset. #1829
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: prevent more file traversal cases related to template names. #1833
* [BUGFUX] Alertmanager: Allow usage with `-alertmanager-storage.backend=local`. Note that when using this storage type, the Alertmanager is not able persist state remotely, so it not recommended for production use. #1836
* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Do not validate alertmanager configuration if it's not running. #1835

* [CHANGE] Changed default storage backends from `s3` to `filesystem` #833
  This effects the following flags:
  * `-blocks-storage.backend` now defaults to `filesystem`
  * `-blocks-storage.filesystem.dir` now defaults to `blocks`
  * `-alertmanager-storage.backend` now defaults to `filesystem`
  * `-alertmanager-storage.filesystem.dir` now defaults to `alertmanager`
  * `-ruler-storage.backend` now defaults to `filesystem`
  * `-ruler-storage.filesystem.dir` now defaults to `ruler`
* [CHANGE] Renamed metric `cortex_experimental_features_in_use_total` as `cortex_experimental_features_used_total` and added `feature` label. #32 #658

* [CHANGE] Memcached client DNS resolution switched from golang built-in to [`miekg/dns`](https://github.com/miekg/dns). #142
* [CHANGE] The metric `cortex_deprecated_flags_inuse_total` has been renamed to `deprecated_flags_inuse_total` as part of using grafana/dskit functionality. #185

* [CHANGE] Shuffle-sharding:
  * `-distributor.sharding-strategy` option has been removed, and shuffle sharding is enabled by default. Default shard size is set to 0, which disables shuffle sharding for the tenant (all ingesters will receive tenants's samples). #888
  * `-ruler.sharding-strategy` option has been removed from ruler. Ruler now uses shuffle-sharding by default, but respects `ruler_tenant_shard_size`, which defaults to 0 (ie. use all rulers for tenant). #889
  * `-store-gateway.sharding-strategy` option has been removed store-gateways. Store-gateway now uses shuffle-sharding by default, but respects `store_gateway_tenant_shard_size` for tenant, and this value defaults to 0. #891

    * `-query-frontend.results-cache.memcached.timeout`
* [CHANGE] Changed the default value of `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled` to `true`. The default configuration must now run the compactor in order to write the bucket index or else queries to long term storage will fail. #924
* [CHANGE] Option `-auth.enabled` has been renamed to `-auth.multitenancy-enabled`. #1130
* [CHANGE] Default tenant ID used with disabled auth (`-auth.multitenancy-enabled=false`) has changed from `fake` to `anonymous`. This tenant ID can now be changed with `-auth.no-auth-tenant` option. #1063
* [CHANGE] The default values for the following local directories have changed: #1072
  * `-alertmanager.storage.path` default value changed to `./data-alertmanager/`
  * `-compactor.data-dir` default value changed to `./data-compactor/`
  * `-ruler.rule-path` default value changed to `./data-ruler/`
* [CHANGE] The default value for gRPC max send message size has been changed from 16MB to 100MB. This affects the following parameters: #1152

* [CHANGE] Remove `-http.prefix` flag (and `http_prefix` config file option). #763
* [CHANGE] Remove legacy endpoints. Please use their alternatives listed below. As part of the removal process we are
  introducing two new sets of endpoints for the ruler configuration API: `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules` and
  `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/**`. We are also deprecating `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules` and `/api/v1/rules`;
  and will remove them in Mimir 2.2.0. #763 #1222

    * For all metrics the value of the "name" label has changed from `frontend.memcached` to `frontend-cache`
  * The following metrics have been removed:
    * `cortex_cache_background_queue_length{name}`
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: merged `query_range` into `frontend` in the YAML config (keeping the same keys) and renamed flags: #825
  * `-querier.max-retries-per-request` renamed to `-query-frontend.max-retries-per-request`
  * `-querier.split-queries-by-interval` renamed to `-query-frontend.split-queries-by-interval`

* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: `-frontend.` flags were renamed to `-query-frontend.`: #1167
* [CHANGE] Query-frontend / Query-scheduler: classified the `-query-frontend.querier-forget-delay` and `-query-scheduler.querier-forget-delay` flags (and their respective YAML config options) as experimental. #1208
* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: Change `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` configuration to limit to maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query. The number of chunks fetched by ingesters AND long-term storare combined should not exceed the value configured on `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query`. [#4260](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4260)
* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: Option `-querier.ingester-streaming` has been removed. Querier/ruler now always use streaming method to query ingesters. #204
* [CHANGE] Querier: always fetch labels from store and respect start/end times in request; the option `-querier.query-store-for-labels-enabled` has been removed and is now always on. #518 #1132
* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: removed the `-store.query-chunk-limit` flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`). `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`) should be used instead. #705
* [CHANGE] Querier/Ruler: `-querier.active-query-tracker-dir` option has been removed. Active query tracking is now done via Activity tracker configured by `-activity-tracker.filepath` and enabled by default. Limit for max number of concurrent queries (`-querier.max-concurrent`) is now respected even if activity tracking is not enabled. #661 #822
* [CHANGE] Querier/ruler/query-frontend: the experimental `-querier.at-modifier-enabled` CLI flag has been removed and the PromQL `@` modifier is always enabled. #941
* [CHANGE] Querier: removed `-querier.worker-match-max-concurrent` and `-querier.worker-parallelism` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). Mimir now behaves like if `-querier.worker-match-max-concurrent` is always enabled and you should configure the max concurrency per querier process using `-querier.max-concurrent` instead. #958
* [CHANGE] Querier: changed default value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` from `0` to `13h`. #967
* [CHANGE] Querier: rename metric `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` to `cortex_query_fetched_chunk_bytes_total` to be consistent with the limit name. #476
* [CHANGE] Ruler: add two new metrics `cortex_ruler_list_rules_seconds` and `cortex_ruler_load_rule_groups_seconds` to the ruler. #906
* [CHANGE] Ruler: endpoints for listing configured rules now return HTTP status code 200 and an empty map when there are no rules instead of an HTTP 404 and plain text error message. The following endpoints are affected: #456
  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules`
  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/{namespace}`
  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules` (deprecated)
  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules/{namespace}` (deprecated)
  * `/api/v1/rules` (deprecated)
  * `/api/v1/rules/{namespace}` (deprecated)
* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed `configdb` support from Ruler backend storages. #15 #38 #819
* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed the support for the deprecated storage configuration via `-ruler.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). Use `-ruler-storage.*` instead. #628
* [CHANGE] Ruler: set new default limits for rule groups: `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group` to 20 (previously 0, disabled) and `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant` to 70 (previously 0, disabled). #847
* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed `-ruler.enable-sharding` option, and changed default value of `-ruler.ring.store` to `memberlist`. #943
* [CHANGE] Ruler: `-ruler.alertmanager-use-v2` has been removed. The ruler will always use the `v2` endpoints. #954 #1100
* [CHANGE] Ruler: `-experimental.ruler.enable-api` flag has been renamed to `-ruler.enable-api` and is now stable. The default value has also changed from `false` to `true`, so both ruler and alertmanager API are enabled by default. #913 #1065
* [CHANGE] Ruler: add support for [DNS service discovery format](./docs/sources/configuration/arguments.md#dns-service-discovery) for `-ruler.alertmanager-url`. `-ruler.alertmanager-discovery` flag has been removed. URLs following the prior SRV format, will be treated as a static target. To continue using service discovery for these URLs prepend `dnssrvnoa+` to them. #993
  * The following metrics for Alertmanager DNS service discovery are replaced:
    * `prometheus_sd_dns_lookups_total` replaced by `cortex_dns_lookups_total{component="ruler"}`
    * `prometheus_sd_dns_lookup_failures_total` replaced by `cortex_dns_failures_total{component="ruler"}`
* [CHANGE] Ruler: deprecate `/api/v1/rules/**` and `<prometheus-http-prefix/rules/**` configuration API endpoints in favour of `/<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/**`. Deprecated endpoints will be removed in Mimir 2.2.0. Main configuration API endpoints are now `/<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/api/v1/rules/**` introduced in Mimir 2.0.0. #1222
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: index cache now includes tenant in cache keys, this invalidates previous cached entries. #607
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: increased memcached index caching TTL from 1 day to 7 days. #718
* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: options `-store-gateway.sharding-enabled` and `-querier.store-gateway-addresses` were removed. Default value of `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.store` is now `memberlist` and default value for `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` changed from `1m` to `0` (disabled). #976
* [CHANGE] Compactor: compactor will no longer try to compact blocks that are already marked for deletion. Previously compactor would consider blocks marked for deletion within `-compactor.deletion-delay / 2` period as eligible for compaction. [#4328](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4328)
* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed support for block deletion marks migration. If you're upgrading from Cortex < 1.7.0 to Mimir, you should upgrade the compactor to Cortex >= 1.7.0 first, run it at least once and then upgrade to Mimir. #122
* [CHANGE] Compactor: removed the `cortex_compactor_group_vertical_compactions_total` metric. #278
* [CHANGE] Compactor: no longer waits for initial blocks cleanup to finish before starting compactions. #282
* [CHANGE] Compactor: removed overlapping sources detection. Overlapping sources may exist due to edge cases (timing issues) when horizontally sharding compactor, but are correctly handled by compactor. #494
* [CHANGE] Compactor: compactor now uses deletion marks from `<tenant>/markers` location in the bucket. Marker files are no longer fetched, only listed. #550
* [CHANGE] Compactor: Default value of `-compactor.block-sync-concurrency` has changed from 20 to 8. This flag is now only used to control number of goroutines for downloading and uploading blocks during compaction. #552
* [CHANGE] Compactor is now included in `all` target (single-binary). #866
* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed `-compactor.sharding-enabled` option. Sharding in compactor is now always enabled. Default value of `-compactor.ring.store` has changed from `consul` to `memberlist`. Default value of `-compactor.ring.wait-stability-min-duration` is now 0, which disables the feature. #956
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-alertmanager.configs.auto-webhook-root` #977
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `configdb` support from Alertmanager backend storages. #15 #38 #819
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Don't count user-not-found errors from replicas as failures in the `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total` metric. #190
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Use distributor for non-API routes. #213
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-alertmanager.storage.*` configuration options, with the exception of the CLI flags `-alertmanager.storage.path` and `-alertmanager.storage.retention`. Use `-alertmanager-storage.*` instead. #632
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: set default value for `-alertmanager.web.external-url=http://localhost:8080/alertmanager` to match the default configuration. #808 #1067
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` flag has been renamed to `-alertmanager.enable-api` and is now stable. #913
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: now always runs with sharding enabled; other modes of operation are removed. #1044 #1126

    * `-alertmanager.cluster.peers`
    * `-alertmanager.cluster.push-pull-interval`
  * The following configuration options are renamed:
    * `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout` to `-alertmanager.peer-timeout`
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the default value of `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store` is now `memberlist`. #1171
* [CHANGE] Ring: changed default value of `-distributor.ring.store` (Distributor ring) and `-ring.store` (Ingester ring) to `memberlist`. #1046
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the `memberlist_kv_store_value_bytes` metric has been removed due to values no longer being stored in-memory as encoded bytes. [#4345](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4345)
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: forward only changes, not entire original message. [#4419](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4419)
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: don't accept old tombstones as incoming change, and don't forward such messages to other gossip members. [#4420](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4420)
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: changed probe interval from `1s` to `5s` and probe timeout from `500ms` to `2s`. #563
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the `name` label on metrics `cortex_dns_failures_total`, `cortex_dns_lookups_total` and `cortex_dns_provider_results` was renamed to `component`. #993
* [CHANGE] Limits: removed deprecated limits for rejecting old samples #799
  This removes the following flags:
  * `-validation.reject-old-samples`
  * `-validation.reject-old-samples.max-age`
* [CHANGE] Limits: removed local limit-related flags in favor of global limits. #725
  The distributor ring is now required, and can be configured via the `distributor.ring.*` flags.
  This removes the following flags:
  * `-distributor.ingestion-rate-strategy` -> will now always use the "global" strategy
  * `-ingester.max-series-per-user` -> set `-ingester.max-global-series-per-user` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-series-per-user` instead
  * `-ingester.max-series-per-metric` -> set `-ingester.max-global-series-per-metric`  to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-series-per-metric` instead
  * `-ingester.max-metadata-per-user` -> set `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-user` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-metadata-per-user` instead
  * `-ingester.max-metadata-per-metric` -> set `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-metric` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-metadata-per-metric` instead
  * In the above notes, `N` refers to the number of ingester replicas
  Additionally, default values for the following flags have changed:
  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-user` from `0` to `150000`
  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-metric` from `0` to `20000`
  * `-distributor.ingestion-rate-limit` from `25000` to `10000`
  * `-distributor.ingestion-burst-size` from `50000` to `200000`
* [CHANGE] Limits: removed limit `enforce_metric_name`, now behave as if set to `true` always. #686
* [CHANGE] Limits: Option `-ingester.max-samples-per-query` and its YAML field `max_samples_per_query` have been removed. It required `-querier.ingester-streaming` option to be set to false, but since `-querier.ingester-streaming` is removed (always defaulting to true), the limit using it was removed as well. #204 #1132
* [CHANGE] Limits: Set the default max number of inflight ingester push requests (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`) to 30000 in order to prevent clusters from being overwhelmed by request volume or temporary slow-downs. #259
* [CHANGE] Overrides exporter: renamed metric `cortex_overrides` to `cortex_limits_overrides`. #173 #407
* [FEATURE] The following features have been moved from experimental to stable: #913 #1002
  * Alertmanager config API

    * Templates count in user config (`-alertmanager.max-templates-count`)
    * Max template size (`-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes`)
* [FEATURE] The endpoints `/api/v1/status/buildinfo`, `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo`, and `<alertmanager-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo` have been added to display build information and enabled features. #1219 #1240
* [FEATURE] PromQL: added `present_over_time` support. #139
* [FEATURE] Added "Activity tracker" feature which can log ongoing activities from previous Mimir run in case of a crash. It is enabled by default and controlled by the `-activity-tracker.filepath` flag. It can be disabled by setting this path to an empty string. Currently, the Store-gateway, Ruler, Querier, Query-frontend and Ingester components use this feature to track queries. #631 #782 #822 #1121
* [FEATURE] Divide configuration parameters into categories "basic", "advanced", and "experimental". Only flags in the basic category are shown when invoking `-help`, whereas `-help-all` will include flags in all categories (basic, advanced, experimental). #840
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added support for tenant federation to exemplar endpoints. #927
* [FEATURE] Ingester: can expose metrics on active series matching custom trackers configured via `-ingester.active-series-custom-trackers` (or its respective YAML config option). When configured, active series for custom trackers are exposed by the `cortex_ingester_active_series_custom_tracker` metric. #42 #672
* [FEATURE] Ingester: Enable snapshotting of in-memory TSDB on disk during shutdown via `-blocks-storage.tsdb.memory-snapshot-on-shutdown` (experimental). #249
* [FEATURE] Ingester: Added `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` flag, which allows disabling TSDB isolation feature. This is enabled by default (per TSDB default), but disabling can improve performance of write requests. #512
* [FEATURE] Ingester: Added `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-chunks-write-queue-size` flag, which allows setting the size of the queue used by the TSDB before m-mapping chunks (experimental). #591
  * Added `cortex_ingester_tsdb_mmap_chunk_write_queue_operations_total` metric to track different operations of this queue.
* [FEATURE] Distributor: Added `-api.skip-label-name-validation-header-enabled` option to allow skipping label name validation on the HTTP write path based on `X-Mimir-SkipLabelNameValidation` header being `true` or not. #390
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_series_total` and `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` per-user counters to expose the number of series and bytes fetched as part of queries. These metrics can be enabled with the `-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). [#4343](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4343)
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_total` per-user counter to expose the number of chunks fetched as part of queries. This metric can be enabled with the `-query-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). #31
* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add query sharding for instant and range queries. You can enable querysharding by setting `-query-frontend.parallelize-shardable-queries` to `true`. The following additional config and exported metrics have been added. #79 #80 #100 #124 #140 #148 #150 #151 #153 #154 #155 #156 #157 #158 #159 #160 #163 #169 #172 #196 #205 #225 #226 #227 #228 #230 #235 #240 #239 #246 #244 #319 #330 #371 #385 #400 #458 #586 #630 #660 #707 #1542
  * New config options:
    * `-query-frontend.query-sharding-total-shards`: The amount of shards to use when doing parallelisation via query sharding.
    * `-query-frontend.query-sharding-max-sharded-queries`: The max number of sharded queries that can be run for a given received query. 0 to disable limit.
    * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes`: Max size - in bytes - of the in-memory series hash cache in the store-gateway.
    * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes`: Max size - in bytes - of the in-memory series hash cache in the ingester.
  * New exported metrics:
    * `cortex_bucket_store_series_hash_cache_requests_total`
    * `cortex_bucket_store_series_hash_cache_hits_total`
    * `cortex_frontend_query_sharding_rewrites_succeeded_total`
    * `cortex_frontend_sharded_queries_per_query`
  * Renamed metrics:
    * `cortex_frontend_mapped_asts_total` to `cortex_frontend_query_sharding_rewrites_attempted_total`
  * Modified metrics:
    * added `sharded` label to `cortex_query_seconds_total`
  * When query sharding is enabled, the following querier config must be set on query-frontend too:
    * `-querier.max-concurrent`
    * `-querier.timeout`
    * `-querier.max-samples`
    * `-querier.at-modifier-enabled`
    * `-querier.default-evaluation-interval`
    * `-querier.active-query-tracker-dir`
    * `-querier.lookback-delta`
  * Sharding can be dynamically controlled per request using the `Sharding-Control: 64` header. (0 to disable)
  * Sharding can be dynamically controlled per tenant using the limit `query_sharding_total_shards`. (0 to disable)
  * Added `sharded_queries` count to the "query stats" log.
  * The number of shards is adjusted to be compatible with number of compactor shards that are used by a split-and-merge compactor. The querier can use this to avoid querying blocks that cannot have series in a given query shard.
* [FEATURE] Query-Frontend: Added `-query-frontend.cache-unaligned-requests` option to cache responses for requests that do not have step-aligned start and end times. This can improve speed of repeated queries, but can also pollute cache with results that are never reused. #432
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added label names cardinality endpoint `<prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_names` that is disabled by default. Can be enabled/disabled via the CLI flag `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` or its respective YAML config option. Configurable on a per-tenant basis. #301 #377 #474
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added label values cardinality endpoint `<prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_values` that is disabled by default. Can be enabled/disabled via the CLI flag `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` or its respective YAML config option, and configurable on a per-tenant basis. The maximum number of label names allowed to be queried in a single API call can be controlled via `-querier.label-values-max-cardinality-label-names-per-request`. #332 #395 #474
* [FEATURE] Querier: Added `-store.max-labels-query-length` to restrict the range of `/series`, label-names and label-values requests. #507
* [FEATURE] Ruler: Add new `-ruler.query-stats-enabled` which when enabled will report the `cortex_ruler_query_seconds_total` as a per-user metric that tracks the sum of the wall time of executing queries in the ruler in seconds. [#4317](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4317)
* [FEATURE] Ruler: Added federated rule groups. #533
  * Added `-ruler.tenant-federation.enabled` config flag.
  * Added support for `source_tenants` field on rule groups.
* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: Added `/store-gateway/tenants` and `/store-gateway/tenant/{tenant}/blocks` endpoints that provide functionality that was provided by `tools/listblocks`. #911 #973
* [FEATURE] Compactor: compactor now uses new algorithm that we call "split-and-merge". Previous compaction strategy was removed. With the `split-and-merge` compactor source blocks for a given tenant are grouped into `-compactor.split-groups` number of groups. Each group of blocks is then compacted separately, and is split into `-compactor.split-and-merge-shards` shards (configurable on a per-tenant basis). Compaction of each tenant shards can be horizontally scaled. Number of compactors that work on jobs for single tenant can be limited by using `-compactor.compactor-tenant-shard-size` parameter, or per-tenant `compactor_tenant_shard_size` override.  #275 #281 #282 #283 #288 #290 #303 #307 #317 #323 #324 #328 #353 #368 #479 #820
* [FEATURE] Compactor: Added `-compactor.max-compaction-time` to control how long can compaction for a single tenant take. If compactions for a tenant take longer, no new compactions are started in the same compaction cycle. Running compactions are not stopped however, and may take much longer. #523
* [FEATURE] Compactor: When compactor finds blocks with out-of-order chunks, it will mark them for no-compaction. Blocks marked for no-compaction are ignored in future compactions too. Added metric `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_no_compaction_total` to track number of blocks marked for no-compaction. Added `CortexCompactorSkippedBlocksWithOutOfOrderChunks` alert based on new metric. Markers are only checked from `<tenant>/markers` location, but uploaded to the block directory too. #520 #535 #550
* [FEATURE] Compactor: multiple blocks are now downloaded and uploaded at once, which can shorten compaction process. #552
* [ENHANCEMENT] Exemplars are now emitted for all gRPC calls and many operations tracked by histograms. #180
* [ENHANCEMENT] New options `-server.http-listen-network` and `-server.grpc-listen-network` allow binding as 'tcp4' or 'tcp6'. #180
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query federation: improve performance in MergeQueryable by memoizing labels. #312
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add histogram metrics `cortex_distributor_sample_delay_seconds` and `cortex_ingester_tsdb_sample_out_of_order_delta_seconds` #488
* [ENHANCEMENT] Check internal directory access before starting up. #1217
* [ENHANCEMENT] Azure client: expose option to configure MSI URL and user-assigned identity. #584
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a new metric `mimir_build_info` to coincide with `cortex_build_info`. The metric `cortex_build_info` has not been removed. #1022
* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimir runs a sanity check of storage config at startup and will fail to start if the sanity check doesn't pass. This is done to find potential config issues before starting up. #1180
* [ENHANCEMENT] Validate alertmanager and ruler storage configurations to ensure they don't use same bucket name and region values as those configured for the blocks storage. #1214
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added option `-ingester.readiness-check-ring-health` to disable the ring health check in the readiness endpoint. When disabled, the health checks are run against only the ingester itself instead of all ingesters in the ring. #48 #126
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory utilization if remote write requests contains a large amount of "out of bounds" samples. #413
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory utilization when querying chunks from ingesters. #430
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Expose ingester ring page on ingesters. #654
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added option `-distributor.excluded-zones` to exclude ingesters running in specific zones both on write and read path. #51
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add tags to tracing span for distributor push with user, cluster and replica. #210
* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: performance optimisations. #212 #217 #242

* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / store-gateway: optimized regex matchers. #319 #334 #355
* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: when fetching data for specific query-shard, we can ignore some blocks based on compactor-shard ID, since sharding of series by query sharding and compactor is the same. Added metrics: #438 #450
  * `cortex_querier_blocks_found_total`
  * `cortex_querier_blocks_queried_total`
  * `cortex_querier_blocks_with_compactor_shard_but_incompatible_query_shard_total`

* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: reduced CPU and memory utilization due to exported metrics aggregation for instances with a large number of tenants. #123 #142
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added an in-memory LRU cache for chunks attributes. Can be enabled setting `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.attributes-in-memory-max-items=X` where `X` is the max number of items to keep in the in-memory cache.

  * `cortex_cache_memory_hits_total`
  * `cortex_cache_memory_items_count`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: log index cache requests to tracing spans. #419
* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: store-gateway can now ignore blocks with minimum time within `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` duration. Useful when used together with `-querier.query-store-after`. #502

* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: skip already planned compaction jobs if the tenant doesn't belong to the compactor instance anymore. #303
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Blocks cleaner will ignore users that it no longer "owns" when sharding is enabled, and user ownership has changed since last scan. #325
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added `-compactor.compaction-jobs-order` support to configure which compaction jobs should run first for a given tenant (in case there are multiple ones). Supported values are: `smallest-range-oldest-blocks-first` (default), `newest-blocks-first`. #364
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: delete blocks marked for deletion faster. #490
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: expose low-level concurrency options for compactor: `-compactor.max-opening-blocks-concurrency`, `-compactor.max-closing-blocks-concurrency`, `-compactor.symbols-flushers-concurrency`. #569 #701
* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: expand compactor logs to include total compaction job time, total time for uploads and block counts. #549

* [BUGFIX] Ingester: prevent any reads or writes while the ingester is stopping. This will prevent accessing TSDB blocks once they have been already closed. [#4304](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4304)
* [BUGFIX] Ingester: TSDB now waits for pending readers before truncating Head block, fixing the `chunk not found` error and preventing wrong query results. #16

* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: worker's cancellation channels are now buffered to ensure that all request cancellations are properly handled. #741
* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed `/api/v1/user_stats` endpoint. When zone-aware replication is enabled, `MaxUnavailableZones` param is used instead of `MaxErrors`, so setting `MaxErrors = 0` doesn't make the Querier wait for all Ingesters responses. #474
* [BUGFIX] Querier: Disable query scheduler SRV DNS lookup. #689
* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed counting of PromQL evaluation errors as user-errors when updating `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`. [#4335](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4335)

* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fixed corrupted packets when sending compound messages with more than 255 messages or messages bigger than 64KB. #551
* [BUGFIX] Overrides exporter: successfully startup even if runtime config is not set. #1056
* [BUGFIX] Fix internal modules to wait for other modules depending on them before stopping. #1472
